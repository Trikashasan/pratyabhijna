The word Trika means “the threefold science of man and his world.” In the idea of trika, there are three Śakti-s (energies): parā (supreme), aparā (lowest), and parāpara (combination of the lowest and the highest). These three primary energies represent the threefold activities of the world. In the thought of the Trika, therefore, it is admitted that this whole universe and every action in it, whether spiritual, physical, or worldly, is existing in these three energies.\n\n\n“THE TRIKA PHILOSOPHY IS MEANT FOR ANY HUMAN BEING WITHOUT THE RESTRICTION OF CASTE, CREED, OR COLOR. ITS PURPOSE IS TO ENABLE YOU TO RISE FROM INDIVIDUALITY TO UNIVERSALITY.”\nSwāmi Lakṣamaṇa Jū\n\n\nThe Trika System is comprised of four sub-schools; the pratyabhijñā school, the kula school, the krama school, and the spanda school. These four systems, which form the one thought of the Trika system, all accept and are based on the same scriptures (Āgama-s). These scriptures form the ninety-two Āgama-s of Shaivism. The monistic Bhairava Śāstra-s are supreme (parā) and are sixty-four in number; the mono-dualistic Rudra Śāstra-s are medium (parāpara) and are eighteen in number; and the dualistic Śiva Śāstra-s are inferior (aparā) and are ten in number."},"Introduction/krama/krama":{"title":"krama","links":[],"tags":["krama","introduction","articles"],"content":"]■[ “Krama System.” ]■[\n⎯ The Krama system does not recognize the ways of either the Pratyabhijna or the Kula system. In the Krama system, you must rise in succession, step by step. This system teaches that step-by-step realization makes your realization firm. As the Krama system is concerned with successive realization, it is primarily concerned with space and time, because where there is succession there you find the existence of space and time. In both the Pratyabhijna and Kula systems you are beyond space and time. In the Krama system, it is in the end, not in its process, that you are beyond time and space because it also carries you to that timeless and space-less state.\n\n“The Krama system is primarily attributed to shaktopaya and to the twelve Kalis.”\n\nThe twelve Kalis are said to be the twelve movements of any one cognition. For example, if you look at any object such as a pot, the sensation travels from your thought to the place of the pot, and then returns again from the place of the pot to your thought, giving you the sensation whereby you realize this pot. You do not realize this pot at the place of the pot, you realize this pot in your mind. Your perception has moved from inside to the pot, and then returned again from the pot to your thought. And these movements are distributed in twelve ways as the twelve Kalis in the Krama system.\nThe rise of prana kundalini is also described in the Krama system, because in prana kundalini you rise from one cakra to another, from one state to another state. As this is a successive process it is found in the Krama system.\nAlthough the Krama system existed in the beginning of kali-yuga, having been introduced by the sage Durvasa, it was reintroduced at the end of the 7th century A.D. in Kashmir by the sage Erakanatha, who was also known as Shivanandanatha. Shivanandanatha had only three chief disciples which he initiated into the Krama system. Because in this system predominance is given only to shakti, all three were females. Their names were Keyuravati, Madanika, and Kalyanika. They were quite prominent and were completely informed in the Krama system. Afterwards, these ladies also initiated disciples, which were both male and female."},"Introduction/kula-akula/kula":{"title":"kula","links":[],"tags":["kula","introduction","articles"],"content":"]■[ “Kula System.” ]■[\n⎯ The Kula system teaches you how you can live in caitanya (universal Consciousness), the real nature of yourself, in the act of ascending and descending. While you rise from the lowest to the highest you realize your nature, and while you descend from the highest to the lowest you also realize your nature.\n“In the Kula system, there is no break in the realization of your own nature either in the highest or in the lowest cycle. This system, therefore, teaches you how you can live in totality.”\nIn fact, the word kula means “totality.”\nIn the practice of the Kula system, you have to realize the totality of the universe in one particle. Take one particle of anything that exists in this world; in that one particle is to be realized the totality of the whole universe. The totality of energy is found in one particle. Everything is full of one thing and one thing is full of all things.\nThe difference between the Pratyabhijna system and the Kula system is, that the Pratyabhijna system teaches you how to realize your own nature in one place and exist there, reside there. While the Kula system teaches you how you can rise from the lowest degree to the highest degree, and all the while, experience the nature of your Self on the same level and state. Shiva, which is realized in prithvi tattva (earth element), is the same level, the same reality of Shiva which is realized in Shiva tattva. Here, there is complete realization in every act of the world.\nThe Kula system was introduced in Kashmir in the beginning of the 5th century A.D. by Shri Macchandanatha. Later, in the 9th century, because its teachings had become distorted, it was reintroduced by Sumatinatha. In the line of masters that followed from Sumatinatha, Somanatha was his disciple. Shambhunatha was the disciple of Somanatha, and the great Abhinavagupta was the disciple of Shambhunatha."},"Introduction/pratyabhijna/pratyabhijñā":{"title":"pratyabhijna","links":[],"tags":["pratyabhijna","introduction","articles"],"content":"]■[ “Pratyabhijna System.” ]■[\n⎯ The word pratyabhijna means “to spontaneously once again recognize and realize your Self.” Here you have only to realize, you do not have to practice. There are no upayas (means) in the Pratyabhijna system. You must simply recognize who you are. Wherever you are, whether you are at the level of Supreme Being, at the level of yoga, or at that level which is disgusting, you can recognize your own Nature then and there without moving anywhere or doing anything.\nFor example, take the case of a bride and groom. The woman has not seen her husband-to-be and craves to see him. Concerning him she has only heard praise and glory but she has not actually met him. Suppose this girl and her future husband happen by chance to go separately on the same pilgrimage. When they arrive at the place of pilgrimage, they meet. The girl, however, does not feel any importance in this man because she does not know him to be her future husband. Yet her future husband and this man are the same person. Later, when a friend introduces her to him, telling her that this is the man who is to be her husband, then she is filled with happiness, pleasure, and ecstasy. She realizes that this is the same man she had seen before.\nIn the same way, reality dawns in the Pratyabhijna system. In whichever level you are situated, do not mind.\n“The moment recognition dawns, not only do you instantaneously become divine, but you also realize that you were already divine.”\nAt that moment, you realize that you were already the Lord but did not know it because you had misunderstood yourself.\nIn the Pratyabhijna philosophy it is your master who tells you, that ‘you are the same person for whom you are longing’, and he teaches you to reach the goal there and then without adopting any means. This teaching, therefore, is situated chiefly in anupaya, which is that means where there are no means at all. It is the recognition that there was nothing to be done and nowhere to go. Here, there is no practice, no concentration and no meditation. By the grace of your master you realize it and you are there.\nThe Pratyabhijna system was flourishing in the beginning of kali-yuga. As time passed, however, it became veiled due to misunderstanding. It wasn’t until the end of the eighth century A.D. that the great master Somananda reintroduced the Pratyabhijna system in Kashmir. Somananda’s disciple was Utpaladeva, and his disciple was Lakshmanagupta, and his disciple was the very great Abhinavagupta."},"Introduction/spanda/spanda":{"title":"spanda","links":[],"tags":["spanda","introduction","articles"],"content":"]■[ “Spanda System.” ]■[\n⎯ The fourth system, which comprises the Trika philosophy, is called the Spanda system. The word spanda means “movement.”\n“The Spanda school recognizes that nothing can exist without movement. Where there is movement there is life, and where there is no movement that is lifelessness.”\nThey realize that there is movement in wakefulness, dreaming, deep sleep, and turya. Though some thinkers argue that there is no movement in deep sleep the philosophers of the Spanda system realize that nothing can exist without movement.\nThe teachings of the Spanda system, which is an important practical system, are found embodied in the “Vijnana Bhairava Tantra,” the “Svacchanda Tantra,” and in the 6th chapter of the “Tantraloka.”\nThe Spanda System was introduced in Kashmir by the great sage Vasuguptanatha at the beginning of the 8th century A.D. Vasuguptanatha is the author of both the “Shiva Sutras” and the “Spanda Karikas.” The disciple of Vasuguptanatha was Kallata.\nSome teachers think that the “Spanda Karikas” were not composed by Vasuguptanatha but rather by his disciple Kallata. This theory, however, is absolutely incorrect."},"Introduction/trikashasan/trikashasan-introduction":{"title":"an introduction to trikaśāsan [tāntrik philosophy]","links":[],"tags":["introduction","trikashasan","articles","lineage","pratyabhijna","kula","krama","spanda","history","origin","kashmirshaivism"],"content":"Lo, the river of Bhāratiya lore and sacred praxis hath flowed through the ages in two mighty streams: the Vedik and the Āgamaic. If the wellspring of the Vedik current be the hallowed exhalation of Vāmadeva, that venerable countenance of Lord Swachchandanātha Bhairava, then verily, the root of the Āgamaic or Tāntrik torrent springeth forth from the august utterances of the fivefold mouths of that same ineffable Lord, Swachchandanātha Bhairava.\nThis Bhairavāgamadhārā, the celestial river of the Bhairavāgamic wisdom, is eternal and unyielding, flowing beyond the bounds of mortal comprehension. It abideth in a state of divine indifference, untainted by the fetters of worldly dualities. Free it is, as the wind that doth wander o’er the plains, and secret as the whisper of the night’s own shadow. Its waters are pure and unsullied, moving ever in accordance with the spontaneous and boundless grace of Lord Swachchandanātha Bhairava.\nThus, from the mouths of the Eternal Lord, whose fivefold utterances resonate with the mysteries of creation, preservation, dissolution, concealment, and grace, doth this sacred stream emerge. It is a current unseen by profane eyes, yet ever-present to the devout and those who walk the path of wisdom. And by this divine flow, unbroken and uncorrupted through the ages, are the veils of ignorance rent asunder, revealing the hidden truths of existence to those whose hearts are kindled by devotion.\nForsooth, the Vedik stream, born of a single breath, singeth the hymns of cosmic order and the laws of righteousness, whilst the Āgamaic stream, a cascade of manifold voices, speaketh of the hidden ways, the secret paths, and the mysteries concealed in the shadowed sanctuaries of the soul. Together, these two streams nourish the vast expanse of Bhāratiya knowledge, each complementing the other as the sun doth complement the moon.\nYet know this: the Āgamaic flow, steeped in secrecy and guarded by the wisdom of the ages, may only be accessed through the grace of Swachchandanātha Bhairava. It is He who, in His infinite compassion, granteth the seeker entrance into this realm of sacred knowledge, wherein the soul is transformed, and the divine is made manifest.\nSuch is the eternal and ineffable stream of Bhāratiya knowledge, flowing forth from the wellspring of the Divine, ever-guided by the hand of the Supreme Lord, Swachchandanātha Bhairava.\n\nAnd, from the sacred wellspring of the Āgamic current, there arose two noble streams of wisdom: the Rudragāma, which standeth as a synthesis of duality and nonduality, and the Shivagāma, rooted more firmly in dualistic understanding. In the fulness of time, the adherents of these venerable traditions, and likewise the followers of the Vedik stream and its kindred paths, didst mingle and interact one with the other. Through such exchanges, the doctrines, customs, and practices of each did become, in some measure, intertwined, creating thereby a moral tradition both mixed and multifaceted.\nThus, the blending of these rivers of thought and devotion did bear forth fruits of great consequence. The Rudrasūkta of the Vedic canon, the Śvetāśvatara Upanishad, and the Paśupata tradition were as tributaries joined to this mighty confluence. Likewise, the Brahma and Tripura Tāpinī Upanishads, the Tripurā literature, and the Katharudra stream did bear testimony to this interweaving. Verily, even in the realm of Bhāvanā and Tāntrik worship, the utterance of Vedic mantras and their sacred employment found a hallowed place. Such mingling of traditions, though born of diversity, became as a bridge between the realms of Vedic and Āgamic thought, enriching both.\nYet let it not be forgotten that the Tāntrik lore, though it doth borrow and lend, remaineth steadfastly distinct in its essence. Its tenets, its principles, and its sacred rites stand apart, forming a body of wisdom both unique and perfect in its own right. Unlike the Vedic path, which doth often speak in the language of universal law and sacrificial order, the Tāntrik path doth turn its gaze inward, delving into the hidden mysteries of the self, the cosmos, and the divine union that lieth beyond the veil of duality.\nThe gift of the Tāntrik stream, therefore, is one of revelation and transformation—a wisdom that doth teach the seeker to transcend the boundaries of the mundane and to commune with the ineffable. For though it doth acknowledge and, at times, employ the tools of the Vedic tradition, its heart beateth to a rhythm wholly its own. Its doctrines, born of the speech of Lord Swachchandanātha Bhairava, are as a treasure hidden in plain sight, veiled yet radiant, distinct yet universal, perfect in their sublime mystery.\nThus, while the mingling of these streams hath yielded a fertile ground of shared practice and belief, the Tāntrik tradition doth yet retain its sacred autonomy, standing as a pillar of spiritual profundity amidst the flowing rivers of Bhāratiya wisdom.\n\nAll philosophies, whether manifold or singular in their essence, do acknowledge the Supreme Being as the primordial root of the universe, albeit in forms that may differ in name and understanding. Yet, in truth, the foundation of all such doctrines and creeds doth rest upon the eternal pillars of Trikahṛdaya and Trikaśāsana. These twin bastions stand as the cornerstone of wisdom, proclaiming the undivided and transcendent nature of the Supreme.\nIn this lofty vision, the Supreme Being is beheld as indivisible and whole, beyond all division and duality. In the profoundest depths of its Absolute state, wherein the Supreme abideth in its most pristine essence, it is said that even the notion of Ćidānanda—the blissful consciousness—is impossible to conceive. For this state is none other than the Niranśa Anūttara Parā—the unfragmented and supreme transcendence. It is a realm where only Sanmātra, the pure being, doth prevail, undisturbed by any stirrings of differentiation or form.\nYet, from this infinite stillness and perfect oneness, there doth spring forth an aspect of the Supreme—a subtle movement, as if the first ripple upon the eternal sea of being. This emergence is the self-luminous essence known as Ćit or Ćiti in the sacred tongue of the Trika. It is a radiance that doth reveal itself, not as an other, but as the very nature of the Supreme, shining forth in the glory of self-awareness. This Ćidbhāva, this state of luminous consciousness, is the first light of the outward orientation of the Supreme, the initial gesture by which the ineffable doth incline towards manifestation.\nIn the venerable language of the Bhairavāgamas, this self-revealing light is called Anūttara, the unsurpassed and unparalleled. It is the primal effulgence, the highest revelation, that standeth as the bridge between the unmanifest and the manifest, the inward stillness and the outward expansion. Within this radiant mystery, the Supreme is both revealed and concealed, its essence both transcendent and immanent.\nThus, the Trika wisdom declareth that the Supreme Being, though ineffable and beyond the grasp of mind or speech, doth yet reveal itself through the eternal dance of Ćiti. And in this revelation is contained the seed of all philosophies and religions, for all streams of thought do trace their origins to this luminous wellspring, where the Supreme doth shine in its own glory as the Anūttara, the unmatched essence of all that is.\n\nThe sacred letter “अ” (a) of the Sanskrit tongue, of the revered Mātṛkā Ćakra as expounded in the Śiva Sūtra, standeth as a symbol of the exalted Anūttara state. This ineffable letter, the primal sound, doth embody the Supreme Being in its highest and most transcendent form. From this eternal and undivided essence, the divine consciousness doth perpetually arise, an unceasing emanation from the boundless depths of the Absolute.\nEven as the mind is drawn outward by the trembling of bliss, so too doth it quiver in harmonious resonance. This vibration, born of the Supreme’s infinite joy, causeth the mind to become externalized, and in this movement doth lie the unfolding of its mystery. By this sacred trembling, on one hand, the mind clings to the essence of bliss, as though embracing the divine nectar that doth flow from the heart of the Absolute. Yet, on the other hand, this same vibration bringeth forth a second mind, a reflection born of its own effulgence.\nThis second mind, like a mirror unto the first, perceiveth itself in its reflection, as though gazing upon its own form within the sacred depths of its origin. Herein lies the subtle interplay of recognition, for this second mind beholdeth its own essence and knoweth itself to be one with that primal consciousness from which it sprang. This recognition, this inward delight of perceiving its own being as a reflection of the Supreme, is what is named bliss.\nThus, the act of self-awareness, born of the vibration of bliss, is both the source and the culmination of divine joy. It is the eternal dance of the mind within itself, wherein the Supreme doth reveal its nature as both the knower and the known, the seer and the seen. In this sacred interplay, the vibration of consciousness unveileth the truth of existence, that all is but the play of the Absolute, delighting in its own infinite glory.\nSo it is that the simple yet profound letter “अ” doth encapsulate this cosmic truth. It is the primal sound, the unstruck note that echoeth through the corridors of eternity, symbolizing the eternal emergence of consciousness from the Supreme. In this, the mystery of existence is made known, and the bliss of self-recognition is revealed as the very essence of all that is.\n\nIn the realm of worldly conduct, the nature of this divine interplay may be likened unto the reflection of a mirror, wherein the image seen is both alike and yet apart from its source. Yet, this mirrored reflection, though bearing semblance, is but partially indistinguishable from Śiva, the Supreme. Such an understanding leadeth to the revelation that the unbroken, undivided essence of being is none other than the form of the mind itself. This form, eternal and pristine, abideth as independent, free from all that is other, untouched by duality or opposition. It is Satyaṃ Śivaṃ Sundaraṃ, the essence of truth, auspiciousness, and beauty, a triune proclamation of the Supreme’s immutable nature.\nThe mind, in this context, is the vessel of pure expression, embodying the essence of Śiva in its purity and the taste of bliss in its experiential delight. According to the venerable rule of the Trinity, Paraṃ Śiva, the Supreme Consciousness, and Paraṃ Śakti, the Supreme Power, are utterly indistinguishable, a truth as self-evident as the inseparability of fire from its burning power. Both are of the same Ćidrupa, the form of consciousness, and are woven together as one, as if two strands of the same eternal thread.\nThis state of union, where the Supreme Śiva and His Śakti are as one, is known as Yāmala, the state of ultimate equality and inclusion. In this exalted realm, all distinctions, even those of gender, do dissolve into the boundless oneness of the Absolute. It is a realm of perfect indifference, where duality holds no sway. Yet, to the Aṇu, the finite individual, bound by the fetters of perception and limitation, this state appeareth as a realm of difference. The discriminating mind, ensnared by its own sense of separation, perceiveth distinction even where none doth truly exist.\nFrom the vantage of worldly understanding, the Supreme, known as Parābhairava, is ever revealed in a fivefold nature, reflecting the fivefold aspects of creation, preservation, dissolution, concealment, and grace. Yet this fivefold expression, though manifest to the eyes of the limited, is but a veiling of the undivided essence of the Supreme.\nThus, the interplay between Śiva and Śakti, the union of fire and its burning power, and the reflection of mind within itself, are but varied expressions of the same eternal truth: that all things emanate from, and return to, the boundless oneness of the Absolute. In this truth, the seeker may come to behold the state of Satyaṃ Śivaṃ Sundaraṃ as the foundation of all existence, and the dance of Yāmala as the eternal embrace of the Supreme.\n\n“TRIKAŚĀSAN” ALSO KNOWN AS “TRIKĀĆĀRA”:\nTRIKAŚĀSANA, that which is also hight TRIKĀĆĀRA, standeth as the pinnacle of all sacred paths and disciplines, the crowning summit unto which all other modes of conduct do ascend. Forsooth, the venerable traditions of Vedāćāra, Vaiśnavaćāra, Śaivāćāra, Dakṣīnāćāra, Vāmāćāra, Siddhāntāćāra, and Kaulāćāra are each but steps upon the great ladder that riseth toward this supreme way of life and realization.\nIn Vedāćāra, the seeker treadeth the path of the ancient hymns and sacrificial rites, wherein the cosmic order and the harmony of the universe are revealed. Vaiśnavaćāra guideth the devotee through the currents of surrender and devotion to the Preserver, wherein love and faith become the vehicle of transcendence. Śaivāćāra, the way of Śiva, unfoldeth the mysteries of the great dissolver, wherein the seeker learneth the wisdom of detachment and the cycles of creation and dissolution.\nDakṣīnāćāra and Vāmāćāra are the twin paths of balance, wherein the seeker doth navigate the polarities of restraint and liberation, purity and power, the right-hand path and the left-hand embrace. In Siddhāntāćāra, the seeker discovereth the framework of ultimate truths, the doctrines that point toward liberation, while Kaulāćāra revealeth the esoteric ways of unity, wherein the sacred and the profane are transcended in the realization of the One.\nYet know this: all these paths, though noble and true, are but tributaries to the great river of TRIKĀĆĀRA, wherein all streams converge. For in this exalted state, the seeker doth ascend beyond the limitations of any single discipline, embracing the triadic wisdom of Śiva, Śakti, and Anu. Herein is the seeker elevated to the supreme realization of unity amidst diversity, of the unbroken whole that encompasseth all dualities and oppositions.\nThus, TRIKĀĆĀRA standeth not as a path among paths, but as the consummation of all paths, the summit wherein the seeker doth transcend the distinctions of doctrine and conduct, and attaineth unto the boundless expanse of the Supreme. It is the essence of all, the pathless path, where the triadic dance of creation, preservation, dissolution, concealment, and grace is revealed in its fullest splendor.\n\nThe doctrine of TRIKAŚĀSAN SVĀTAṆTRYAVĀDA, the exalted philosophy of the supreme freedom of consciousness, is twofold in its nature: first, the philosophical foundation; and second, the aspect of Sādhanā, or spiritual practice. These two facets, like the twin wings of a great bird, uphold the sublime edifice of Trika wisdom, enabling the seeker to soar into the boundless expanse of divine realization.\nOn the philosophical side, the great Trikahṛdaya–Siddha Gurus, those illumined masters who have realized the heart of Trika, have expounded the profound truths of Pratyabhijñā (self-recognition) and Spanda (the vibratory principle). Among these illustrious sages are Lord Śrī Mahāmaheśwara Somānanda, the venerable composer of Śivadṛṣṭi; Lord Śrī Mahāmaheśwara Bhaṭṭakallatji, the proclaimer of the Spandakārīkā; Lord Śrī Mahāmaheśwara Vāsuguptaji, the divine receiver of the Śiva Sūtras; Lord Śrī Mahāmaheśwara Utpaldevaji, the sage of Īśvarapratyabhijñā; and the peerless Lord Śrī Mahāmaheśwara Abhinavaguptaji, who crowned this lineage with the masterpiece Tantrāloka and illuminated its mysteries. These towering works articulate the supreme principles of Pratyabhijñā and the sacred order of vibration, unveiling the eternal truths of the Trika tradition.\nIn the realm of Sādhanā, the practical mysteries of this divine path are expounded in the sacred texts of the Bhairavāgamas, such as Tantrāloka, Śriparātriṃśikā, and the revered Śri Svachchanda Tantra, revealed through the boundless grace of Gurudeva Bhagavān Śrī Mahāmaheśwara Abhinavaguptaḥ. Herein, the seeker is guided into the heart of spiritual experience, wherein the philosophical truths are not merely understood but lived and realized.\nOn the philosophical side, the principles established by these great sages, fortified by logical argument and direct insight, have attained universal acceptance and remain unaltered to this day. Such truths, rooted in the eternal essence of Śiva, are impervious to the vicissitudes of time, standing unrefined and unmodified across the ages.\nYet, in the realm of spiritual cultivation, many forms and methods have arisen since ancient times. The masters of Trika, moved by the diverse needs and capacities of their disciples, devised varied paths of Sādhanā, each tailored to lead the aspirant toward the realization of the divine truths expounded in the philosophical tradition. These sacred paths, known as Āćāras, became vehicles for the direct transmission of wisdom, each carrying the essence of Trika teachings while adapting to the individual seeker’s journey. Among these, TRIKĀĆĀRA stands as one of the principal practices, embodying the unbroken essence of the Śaiva Trikaśāsana tradition of Kashmir.\nThis great tradition, encompassing the luminous teachings of Abheda–Trikāćāra—the path of non-difference—unites all aspects of the Trika system, from the transcendental truths of Pratyabhijñā to the vibratory mysteries of Spanda. In this sacred unity, the seeker is guided from intellectual understanding to spiritual realization, attaining the supreme freedom of the Absolute, wherein all distinctions dissolve, and the eternal oneness of Śiva is revealed.\n—  Ｎａｇｋｕｍａｒ です."},"Origin/birth-of-the-tantras-in-trika":{"title":"birth of the tantras in trika","links":[],"tags":["history","origin","lineage","tantra","kashmirshaivism","introduction","trika","articles"],"content":"\nBhairava and Bhairavi (At the down of Satyayuga)\nThe Beginning:\nIn the beginning of Satyuga Lord Śiva appeared in the form of Svacchandanātha. As Svacchandanātha, He appeared with five heads and eighteen arms. His five heads came into manifestation through his five great energies: cit śakti, all consciousness; ānanda śakti, all bliss; icchā śakti, all will; jñāna śakti, all knowledge; and kriyā śakti, all action. And these five energies, which appeared in His five mouths and which are known as īśāna, tatpuruṣa, aghora, vāmadeva and sadyojāta, because of the grace (anugrahaḥ) of Lord Śiva, experienced the sensation of illuminating the Universe.\nSvacchandanātha &amp; The Manifestation of 92 Āgama-s:\nLord Śiva wanted to enlighten the universe by manifesting the existence of the Tantras. In order to accomplish this, He manifested these Tantras through his five mouths. Initially, each of these mouths—īśāna, tatpuruṣa, aghora, vāmadeva and sadyojāta—created one Tantra. Then two mouths joined together and created one Tantra from each combination of two mouths. And then three mouths joined together and created one Tantra from each combination of three mouths. And then four mouths joined together, and then five mouths, and these combinations of mouths produced all of the Tantras of our Śaivism.\nThese Tantras are manifested in three ways. Initially, ten Tantras came into existence which were dualistic (bheda) and are called Śiva Tantras. These Tantras, which are not connected with Kashmir Śaivism, are filled with dualism. Then eighteen Tantras came into existence, which were filled with that thought which is monism cum dualism (bhedābheda). These Tantras are called Rudra Tantras. And finally, these five mouths came into existence in such a way that each and every mouth was simultaneously filled with the other four mouths. Here, four of the five energies were inserted into the fifth energy in such a way that it became full with all five energies. No one energy was in predominance, all were equal. And this happened to each and every energy. Simultaneously, from these mouths came the Bhairava Tantras, which are filled with only monistic thought (abheda). These Bhairava Tantras, which are the Tantras connected with Kashmir Śaivism, are sixty-four in number.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nĀgama-sState64 Bairavāgama-sParā, Abheda, Brutally Non-dualistic tantras18 Rudrāgama-sParāpara, Bhedābheda, Dualistic cum Non-dualistic tantras10 Śivāgama-sApara, Bheda, Dualistic tantras\nIn the Bhairava Tantras, Lord Śiva is shown to be in predominance everywhere. He is there in fullness in Śiva and in all of His energies. He is equally present in everything and everywhere. You cannot say that something is closer to Him and something else is farther away. In everything He is there, fully and completely.\nVākćtuṣtaya-s (States of Speech) &amp; The Transmission of Āgama-s:\nInitially, this monistic Tantra, in the form of one Supreme Consciousness and Bliss, was not manifested in will, imagination, or words; rather, it was felt and observed by Lord Śiva Himself at the start of the illuminating energy. At this point, the manifestation of this Tantra resided in Lord Śiva’s innermost speech, known as Parāvāk (supreme speech). In this supreme speech of Lord Śiva, the creation of vācya and vācaka, master and disciple, was not yet felt as being differentiated. They resided in His own Being as undifferentiated. In the next movement of illuminating energy, the manifestation of the Tantras was held in his second speech, paśyantī. At this stage also, these Tantras were still undifferentiated and were one with His Supreme Will. In the next movement of illuminating energy, these Tantras were held in His third speech, madhyamā vāk. Here, they became differentiated and were manifested internally only in thought not in words. And in the final movement of illuminating energy, these Tantras were held in His fourth speech, vaikharī vāk, where they came out through His five mouths in differentiation as words, sentences, and verses.\nThe Revival of Trika in Kalyug:\nIn the three yugas (ages), satyuga, tretāyuga, and dvāparayuga, masters and disciples were initiated verbally, not in writing, requiring words and sentences. The power of memory in them was so great that they remembered everything instantaneously. There was no need for them to write anything down or to refer to books and papers. The masters and disciples were very great during these three yugas.\nWhen kaliyuga occurred, these masters and disciples were so disappointed that they hid themselves in unknown places in order to avoid the touch of worldly people living at that time. Because of this, the theory of the Bhairava Tantras and Kashmir Śaivism was lost. Lord Śiva, however, always wishes to illuminate the universe and so He reappeared in this world at Mount Kailāśa, not in the form of Svacchandanātha with five mouths, but in the form of Śrīkaṇṭhanātha. And in the form of Śrīkaṇṭhanātha, He again taught the theory of the Bhairava Tantras to the sage Durvāsā Ṛṣi, who was ūrdhvaretaḥ, which means “one whose power of sex is preserved,” and who was, therefore, a brahmacārī (celibate). When Śrīkaṇṭhanātha initiated him at Mount Kailāśa, Śrīkaṇṭhanātha told him that he was to expand the thought of Bhairava Tantras in all of the universe without restriction to caste, color, or creed. After Śrīkaṇṭhanātha taught Durvāsā Ṛṣi in this manner, he disappeared into the ether.\n\nŚiva Pārvatī Pariwār (Art: Unknown)\nThe First Parameṣthī Guru of Trikaśāsana - Durvāsā Ṛṣi:\nDurvāsā Ṛṣi, after meditating completely to acquire a real and fit disciple for initiation, became disappointed. He could not find anyone in this world fit to be initiated. His initiation was a practical initiation because, while initiating someone in the thought of Bhairava Tantras, he simultaneously initiated him in the practical side of this thought. And this practical initiation manifested itself immediately without the disciples having to do any practice or yoga. This disciple would become instantaneously enlightened. As he could not find a disciple fit for this initiation, he created out of his mental power one mind-born son. This mind-born son was called Tryambakanātha. Durvāsā Ṛṣi completely initiated Tryambakanātha in the way of the monistic Bhairava Tantras. Afterwards, he created two more mind-born sons, Āmardakanātha and Śrīnātha. He initiated his son Āmardakanātha in the dualistic Śiva Tantras and he initiated his other son Śrinātha in the monodualistic Rudra Tantras. All of this was done by Durvāsā Ṛṣi for the upliftment of mankind.\n\nA painting depicting Durvasa\nFor the upliftment of women, Durvāsā Ṛṣi created one mind-born daughter and she was called Ardhatryambakā. As Kashmir Śaivism does not recognize women to be in a state of degradation, Durvāsā Ṛṣi initiated her completely in the monistic thought of Bhairava Tantras. As this view, that women are not in a state of degradation, is not held by the other two schools of Śaivism, the dualistic and monodualistic schools, Durvāsā Ṛṣi created only one-mind born daughter. His daughter Ardhatryambakā’s teaching is known as the Ardhatryambaka school of the Bhairava Tantras. But as the continuity of the Ardhatryambaka school manifested itself from one woman to another secretly, there is no history of this school in this kaliyuga.\nThe Unbroken Lineage of Trika:\nDurvāsā Ṛṣi’s son Tryambakanātha, the founder of the monistic school of Śaivism, was also a celibate (brahmacārī). According to the way of the sage Durvāsā Ṛṣi, he also created one mind-born son and named him Tryambakāditya, which means “the expansion of Tryambakanātha.” After initiating him completely in Bhairava Tantras, Tryambakanātha entered a cave, which is known as Tryambaka Guhā (cave), and disappeared. Tryambakanātha’s son Tryambakāditya also created one mind-born son and, after initiating him, Tryambakāditya disappeared into the ether.\n\nPancamukhī Śiva Pārvatī &amp; Nandi alongside Ṛṣabha bull (Art: Unknown)\nIn this manner fifteen siddhas were created by mind. When, however, the fifteenth siddha attempted to create a mind-born son, he was not successful. It is said that this fifteenth siddha was not fully introverted, but at the same time he was also given to worldly pleasures. Because of this subtle impurity (āṇava mala), he was not successful in creating a mind-born son. After sitting in long meditation, he found in this world a girl with all good qualities and he went to her father and made arrangements to marry her. After marriage, they created one son who was called Saṁgamāditya and who, by his will, came to the valley of Kashmir and found Kailāśa mountain. Saṁgamāditya, like his father, married and produced one son named Varṣāditya, whom he initiated completely in the thought of the monistic Bhairava Tantras. Varṣāditya also married and produced one son, named Aruṇāditya, whom he initiated fully. Aruṇāditya married and created one son named Ānanda, whom he initiated and who was also completely informed practically in Śaivism.\nThis sage Ānanda was the father of Somānandanātha, the originator of the Pratyabhijñā School of Śaivism and the author of the “Śiva Dṛṣṭi.” Up to the time of Somānandanātha, the initiation into the monistic thought of Bhairava Tantras took place from father to son. From Somānandanātha on, this initiation took place from master to disciple. Somānandanātha was the master of Utpaladeva. Utpaladeva was the master of Lakṣmaṇagupta. And Lakṣmaṇagupta was a master of our great Abhinavagupta, who was in the line of Atrigupta.\nNow I will explain to you how this Atrigupta, a great scholar of Kashmir Śaivism, came from India to live in the Kashmir Valley.\nDuring his reign, the king Lalitāditya traveled to India from Kashmir, where in Antarvedi, a tract of land in Madhya Pradesh which lies between the Yamuna and Ganga rivers, he discovered this great Śaiva teacher Atrigupta. Lalitāditya was deeply impressed by the scholarship and practical way of Atrigupta and requested him to accompany him to the Kashmir Valley. Atrigupta agreed and upon reaching Kashmir, was given the old palace of Pravarasena to live in because it was very near to the palace of the king Lalitāditya. After he moved to Kashmir, there was no authority on Kashmir Śaivism left in India. From this time forward, the teaching of the thought of Bhairava Tantras is called Kashmir Śaivism and this teaching has continued to remain centered only in the Kashmir Valley. These Bhairava Tantras are pervasive throughout the whole world.\nHowever, they began in the Kashmir Valley, resided there, and are still alive there today. After some centuries in the house of Atrigupta, Varāhagupta was born. He is the father of Narasiṁhagupta and Narasiṁhagupta is the father of our great Abhinavagupta. Although Abhinavagupta had many disciples, both men and women, his chief disciple was Kṣemarāja and the chief disciple of Kṣemarāja was Yogarāja. After many centuries in the Kashmir Valley, Svāmī Ram came into this physical body. His chief disciple was Svāmī Mahatābakak and my Guru Swāmi Lakṣamaṇa Jū Mahārāj is the disciple of Svāmī Mahatābakak and I am disciple of Swāmi Lakṣamaṇa Jū Mahārāj.\n\nSwāmi Lakṣamaṇa Jū Mahārāj"},"Practices/external-discipline":{"title":"external discipline","links":["Practices/internal-posture"],"tags":["discipline","practices","awareness","sadhana","yama","niyama","articles"],"content":"—Yama Niyama—\n —Swami Lakshamanjoo—\n∫Sunday, April 27, 1980∫\nEvery human being must strive for self-realization. When the individual self has right knowledge of the universal Self and recognizes its Divinity without the least apprehension, it is known as Union or Yoga. Patanjali has explained eight limbs of Yoga in his Yoga-Sutras. However The Kashmir Śaiva philosophy also recognizes the Yoga-Sutras and we have our own independent system for limbs of Yoga, where it is stressed that the first two parts, i.e. Yamas and Niyamas must have already been practised. In Kashmir Śaivism the eight limbs of Yoga begin from Asanas—the right posture. By practising the first two one prepares oneself for the spiritual path. This is the development of etiquette. This is the external behavior. Unless one develops the external behavior how can one delve deeper into subtleties!\n\nनित्योदिता पराशक्तिर्यद्यप्येषा तथापि च।\nबाह्यचर्याविहीनस्य दुर्लभा कौलिकी स्थितिः॥\n— Quoted by Jayarathа on Tantraloka 12.16.\nMeaning:\nThe power of supreme consciousness is always present in awareness, always pure and untainted. But for a person who lacks in external behaviour, it is impossible to get established in this unalloyed bliss.\n\nTherefore, unless the aspirant has become well prepared in the external behaviour, or developed the right etiquette, he is bound down with chains of illusion/limitedness and doubt more and more in the prison of this world.\nतथा हि शंका मालिन्यं ग्लानिः संकोच इत्यदः॥\nसंसारकारागारान्तः स्थूलस्थूणाघटायते।\n— Tantraloka 12.20-21.\nMeaning:\nIgnorance is the subtlest impurity which gives rise to doubt. This loosens the spirit of courage to advance towards purity of mind and renders lethargic. Automatically one gets bound to limitation of body etc. This causes degradation. Thus the human being gets strongly tethered like tame animal with the rope of ignorance in the prison of this world.\n\nTherefore, it is necessary that one must first execute one’s efforts towards the development of external behaviour or etiquette for becoming fit to receive grace of the Master.\nOtherwise, the one upon whom the Master becomes angry is left out:—\nगुरुर्हि कुपितो यस्य स तिरोहित उच्यते।\n—Tantraloka 23.63.\nThe favour of doing good is denied to him.\nIt is, therefore, stressed that the five Yamas (internal disciplines) should be followed first:—\n∆ Non-violence (Ahiṃsa) ∆ — Do not hurt anybody by mind, word or deed. Do not reveal the faults of others. Keep quiet. Do not look to others&#039; faults. Seeing your ideal they will by themselves be set right. By practising this virtue one&#039;s foes turn into friends in course of time.\n∆ Truth (Satyaṁ) ∆ — Do not harbour any idea of deceit and trouble in the mind in your dealings with others. Speak the loving and sweet truth. Do not use harsh words in doing so, lest the listener&#039;s feelings should get hurt in any way. Be friendly with all. Being truthful in this sense your word of blessing will bear immediate fruit. Your word will be effective.\n∆ Non-stealing (Astēyaṁ) ∆ — Do not have any idea of stealing through your mind, word or deed. Never even think, for instance, “what a nice watch he has. I would like to have this.” Mere thinking like this involves you in the crime of theft. One who never steals or becomes greedy, enjoys real happiness.\n∆ Celibacy (Brahmacaryaṁ) ∆ — Maintain high character in mind, word and deed. Even the householder, who leads his life according to the injunctions of the Sacred Ordinance, can live the life of Brahmacaryaṁ—celibacy. To be given to the practice of the Realization of Self is also termed celibacy. Such a person gets wonderful powers and no common man can compete him.\n∆ Non-hoarding (Aparigrahaḥ) ∆ — Hoarding money and articles of enjoyment out of selfish aim will avail you no good. Do not keep more than what suffices your needs. If you do you are committing a great social evil. By the practice of this virtue you can have clear knowledge of past and future births.\nYou must also practise the following Niyamas (external disciplines) in right earnest:—\n∆ Purity (Śaucaṁ) ∆ — Dress and food must be clean and pious. Internal purity is to have healthy and pious thoughts and friendliness towards all. Attachment and hatred are both impurities. Throw them off into the river so that they do not come to you again. By doing so you will understand that this body is always impure. Renunciation will dawn. \n∆ Contentment (Santōṣaṁ) ∆ — Have faith in yourself and never be greedy. You will get immense joy. You must be always up and doing but do not feed greed.\n∆ Penance (Tapas) ∆ — Follow your duty according to your own capacity and circumstances, even if you may have to face hardship. Your internal organs will get purified by doing so. You will develop fine intellect to enable you to understand the subtleties of life.\n∆ Self-study (Svadhyāya) ∆ — Study of the sacred scriptures of Trīka śāsana leading to knowledge of Self. Repetition of Gāyatrī Mantra with Aum syllable and breathing exercise (Prāṇāyāma) will lead you to study your own self. By this you can receive the favour of your ideal deity.\n∆ Surrender to Self (Īśvarapraṇidhānaṁ) ∆ — Always resign yourself to the will of Self. That will ward off all obstacles and grant success in concentration.\nIn summing up, I have to say again that unless you are friendly among yourselves, unless you cultivate the habit of being truthful, unless you give up looking to the faults of others, unless you eradicate greed and unless you cast your life according to the injunctions of the Sacred Ordinance, mere studying and learning lessons will avail nothing. Your thoughts must be pure and pious, you must be able to avoid greed with full confidence and faith in your own actions—Both past and present, you must increase your power of tolerance and endurance and you must witness your own deeds resigning everything to the will of Self. Then life will be beautiful and you will be blessed.

This is called the Pause.\nमध्यमं प्राणमाश्रित्य प्राणापानपथान्तरम् ।\nआलम्ब्य ज्ञानशक्तिं च तत्स्थं चैवासनं लभेत् ॥\n—Netra Tantra VI.1ff.\nMeaning:\nResting in the middle path at the junction–point of the inhaling and exhaling breaths with full awareness, constitutes the seat asana—of the yogi.\n“मध्यमं प्राणमाश्रित्य” (Madhyamaṁ praṇamāśritya) — Means that you should be aware at the juncture. You must be able to sit or pause at the middle path—the point where the two breaths meet; i.e. the point where the out-going breath exhausts and the in-coming breath takes strength. This is the junction of the middle point. You have to pause there. This is the centre of the two breaths. This is the important point which you can mark just after the stoppage of the out-going breath and just before the start of the in-coming breath and vice-versa. This point is at the end of the external measure of twelve units and at the end of the internal measure of twelve units of breath respectively. You have to concentrate with awareness at that point, which may be termed as centre also. Not only this. You have to concentrate at this centre even while you are taking your breath in or sending it out. Even while inhaling and exhaling you have to try to dwell at this centre with awareness. This is a super-conscious state, attainable through psychic energy.\nन दिवा पूजयेद्देवं रात्रौ नैव च नैव च ।\nअर्चयेद् देवदेवेशं दिनरात्रिपरिक्षये ॥\nMeaning:\nDo not worship the self-luminous Lord either at night or during the day. You must worship the Lord of lords at the junction of day and night.\nDay here means the out-going breath–prāṇa. Night means the in-coming breath–apāṇa. Parikṣaye does not mean “on being destroyed.” It means “at the junction, at the middle point of the two breaths” or you may call it the centre. So you must try to remain aware at the meeting point of the two breaths. I tell you firmly, if one can truly remain at the junction thus one is bound to succeed in one’s spiritual practice.\nWhen my master taught me spiritual practice, I did not follow first. Without following the instructions correctly I started the practice. Just as I ask Makhan Lal Mujoo to do a particular work, he stands up quickly and starts doing it without following the instructions well. I was just taking my breath in and out. Nothing happened, no experience. In this course I felt sleepy and in a dreaming condition also I was taking my breath in and out in the same way as I did while awake. In this condition also I felt that I was achieving nothing. I thought, during the course of the dream, that it was mere waste of time. I went to the Ashrama. There I saw my grand master sitting in his usual pose. I related my difficulty to him. I told him that my master had instructed me to do spiritual practice in such and such way and that on doing so nothing had happened. He, in reply, told me that I should remain at the junction. Just then I woke up.\nLater I related this whole dream and the preceding disappointment to my master. He said, “You make haste, without following the instructions well you got up and took to spiritual practice. You must follow the instructions perfectly well first and then sit for the practice. Taking to spiritual practice with awareness is not an easy job. You have to be aware there at the door of brahmapuri. You have to remain waiting and watching at the middle point, called sandhi or sandh.”\nSo you will succeed in spiritual practice only when you can remain aware at the junction, at the middle point. This is called madhya dhāma. I just told you: “na divā pūjayet devaṁ, rātrau naiva ca naiva ca.”\nयुञ्जन्नेवं सदात्मानं योगी नियतमानसः ।\nशान्तिं निर्वाणपरमां मत्संस्थामधिगच्छति ॥\n—Gītā VI.15.\nMeaning:\nThus the yogi who with his well governed mind, constantly dwells on Self, attains lasting peace that consists of supreme bliss.\nYou must not do the spiritual practice in a routine way. You have to do it with eagerness. You must be earnest about it. You must sit for spiritual practice after liberating yourself from all kinds of distraction.\n“Madbhaktaḥ” means one who is attached to spiritual practice. One who is very earnest about it.\nYou must be able to find and feel joy in spiritual practice. It must not be like a burden to you, or you must not feel it like that.\n“Śantiṁ” means that you must attain to the peace of the true self. You must feel peaceful. What kind of peace?\n“Nirvāṇa paramāṁ” this means that peace which will lead you towards mokṣa or liberation. That is it.\n“Matsaṁsthāṁ” means that peace should be in my kingdom. It should be in my true Self.\nSo you must first try to undo all the intricate knots of your mind. This is very important. You must try your utmost at this otherwise it is all waste. All time and all efforts get wasted. You cannot get any fruit of your efforts without awareness. You must attend to this point first.\nYou must follow your preceptor, your guide. Do not look for help from your fellow traveller. To get rid of all kinds of obstacles you must follow the instructions of your Guru alone. You must wait for his word and you must watch his hissing sound. That is the clear way for the purification of mind.\nThat will do for today.\nRest on the next Sunday.\n∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞\nSource:\n— The Awareness Of The Supreme Consciousness; Revealed by Īśvarasvarupa Swāmī Lakṣamaṇajū."},"Practices/purity-of-mind":{"title":"purity of mind","links":[],"tags":["discipline","practices","mind","purity","awareness","yama","niyama","asana","shuddhachitt","sadhana","articles"],"content":"—Śuddhacitt &amp; Āsana—\n—Swami Lakshamanjoo—\n∫Sunday, May 4, 1980∫\n\nPurity of mind is the first requisite for spiritual practice. If the mind is free from attachment and detachment, love and hatred, praise and blame, it can remain stable; and then it is termed a clean mind. You must be able to cultivate equality in spirit. Then only will spiritual practice become successful. Otherwise all goes vain and nothing is achieved. The first and foremost condition for spiritual practice is the adoption of a steady posture.\nWhichever recognized pose you adopt for yourself or is advised by your master, you must stick to it and you must be able to remain in it for long at least two hours and without the slightest movement or distraction. There should be no cause for making any movement. You should not yawn, nor look sideways, you should not stretch your muscles. There should be no bending position. You must be able to sit straight with your spinal column erect. You must sit like a rock. Then by mere sitting thus and even without doing any spiritual practice, your mind will become steady, serene and purified. This is called the “conquest of posture” — āsanajaya. By this the spiritual practice easily gains strength. You can see this for yourselves. Even one hour’s sitting without any movement, will give your mind steadiness. You will feel peace.\nThen you will feel no necessity of practising the conquest of mind according to this sloka of the Bhagavad Gitā:—\nयतो यतो निश्चरति मनश्चञ्चलमस्थिरम् ।\nततस्ततो नियम्यैतदात्मन्येव शमं नयेत् ॥\n— Gītā VI.26\nMeaning:\nRestraining the restless and unsteady mind from all those objects after which it runs, one should concentrate it on Self.\nThere is no need of following this practice. By conquering the posture the mind automatically becomes stable. This is stated in the Gitā:—\nसमं कायशिरोग्रीवं धारयन्नचलं स्थिरः ।\nसम्प्रेक्ष्य नासिकाग्रं स्वं दिशश्चानवलोकयन् ॥\nप्रशान्तात्मा विगतभीर्ब्रह्मचारिव्रते स्थितः ।\nमनः संयम्य मच्चित्तो युक्त आसीत मत्परः ॥\n—Gītā VI.13-14.\nMeaning:\nWith body, head and neck upright and steady, eyes turned to the point of the nose and gaze not wandering; maintaining internal calm, fearless, determined on the vow of brahmacaryaṁ and with the mind well governed, he should sit harmoniously absorbed in Self.\n“समं कायशिरोग्रीवं” (Samaṁ kāyaśirōgrīvaṁ) — That means that body, mind, neck and head should remain straight during the whole time of spiritual practice. That is the true posture. That should be acalaṁ—without any movement, and then the practiser&#039;s mind should be sthīraḥ—one-pointed, fixed on one object. All the formalities and preliminary duties should have been fulfilled, even the obligations pertaining to bodily needs. There should be no kind of distraction, i.e. clothes must have been washed and vegetables etc. purchased.\nThen sit in your posture for spiritual practice.\nWhere? Which is the place for that?\n“संपश्यन्नासिकाग्रं स्वं” (Saṁpaśyaṇnāsikāgraṁ svaṁ) — At the end of the twelve unit measure of your breath i.e. at dvādaśānta. You must seat yourself at the point of concentration as taught to you by your master. Exactly with the same zeal and in the same way as at the beginning should you mentally sit at the point of concentration.\nWhat else is to follow?\n“दिशचानवलोकयन्” (Diśaścanavalokayaṇ) — You should carry no load of unnecessary thinking with you, no worry, and no care.\n“प्रशान्तात्मा” (Praśaṇtātmā) — You must not have to think: “I shall be late for office, I have to see such and such a person, I have to attend this business or that. Now I should run through my practice and leave early.” No, forget all this first and then take to spiritual practice.\n“विगतभीः” (Vigatabhīḥ) — You should not have this fear in mind that you have left that piece of work half-done and that you will have to face a loss. In this context you may think, “this is a more important piece of work to attend, this is duty. So I shall leave this spiritual practice half-way or I shall resume it later.” This must not be done.\n“ब्रह्मचारिव्रते स्थितः” (Brahmacārivratē sthitaḥ) — You must remain in continued concentration on the real nature of Parabhairava, which is Supreme Consciousness. That is the vow of brahmacaryaṁ. A brahmacārī is not only one who has a big tilaka (a colour sign besmeared) on his forehead or who only attends to his long matted hair hanging from the top of his head, or who displays a big rosary round his neck or any other sign of the sort. Maintaining Supreme Consciousness alone, constant and continued, is brahmacarya.\nSo far I have talked to you about the conquest of posture—āsanajaya in the process of purifying the mind.\n∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞\nSource:\n— The Awareness Of The Supreme Consciousness; Revealed by Īśvarasvarupa Swāmī Lakṣamaṇajū."},"Shiva-Shakti/parasambandha":{"title":"△▽⛥ PARASAṀBHAṄDHA ⛥▽△","links":["tags/ŚS"],"tags":["agama","parasambandha","guru","shishya","master","disciple","shiva","shakti","origin","articles","ŚS"],"content":"According to the esoteric traditions of Kashmir, Tantra is held to be eternal, a truth without beginning and without end. Even as the sacred Vedās, revered through the Tāntrik Ṣruti Tradition, are esteemed to have been known and practiced in this mortal realm since time beyond reckoning, so too hath the sacred path of Tantra been followed by the unbroken lineage of Tāntrik Gurus. Yea, in truth, the Ṣruti Tradition itself was in its origin none other than the Tāntrik method, which was later embraced and woven into the streams of the Vedik way.\nTantra, eternal as the heavens and profound as the cosmic depths, hath ever been the foundation of sacred knowledge. It is the primal root whence the Ṣruti Tradition sprang, the wellspring of divine revelation that shaped the Vedik streams. Through the ages, the Gurus of Tantra, torchbearers of mystic wisdom, have passed this sacred practice from heart to heart, preserving its essence against the tide of forgetfulness. This tradition is not new nor of recent invention; rather, it is the timeless truth, veiled yet constant, stretching from the dawn of creation unto the endless ages to come.\n\nThus, in solemn remembrance and deep reverence, it is understood that the Tantra, being the cradle of spiritual wisdom, abideth as eternal as the soul itself.\nAs, Mahāmaheśvara Trikāćārya Somānaṅda Nāth Ji, of noble wisdom and mastery, doth proclaim:—\nशैवादीनि रहस्यानि पूर्वमासन् महात्मनाम्।\nऋषीणां वक्त्रकुहरे तेष्वेवानुग्रहक्रिया॥\nकलौ प्रवृत्ते यातेषु तेषु दुर्गमगोचरे।\nकलापिग्रामप्रमुखे समुच्छिन्ने च शासने॥\nकैलासाद्री भ्रमन् देवो मूर्त्या श्रीकण्ठया सह।\nअनुग्रहायावतीर्णश्चोदयामास भूतले॥\nमुनिं दुर्वाशसं नाम भगवानूर्ध्वरेतसम्।\nनोच्छिद्येत यथा शास्त्रं रहस्यं कुरु तादृशम्॥\nIn the days of yore, when the world was young and wisdom flowed as freely as the rivers from the mountains, the sacred scriptures known as the Śaiva Āgama were borne upon the lips of the venerable sages. These holy utterances, untainted by the touch of mortal hands, were the very embodiment of the Ṣrutiparaṃpara, the unbroken lineage of divine oral transmission. Thus did the sages, keepers of this celestial knowledge, bestow their favors upon their disciples, passing down the sacred teachings from heart to heart, as a lamp doth kindle another without diminishing its flame.\nYet, as the wheel of time turned and the shadow of Kāli Yuga fell upon the earth, this esoteric tradition waned, its light dimmed and its presence confined to but a solitary village known as Kalāpi. In this darkened age, when wisdom was scarce and the hearts of men were heavy with the burden of ignorance, the Great Lord Parameśvara Śankara, the Supreme One, walked amidst the celestial peaks of Mount Kailash. Moved by compassion for the fading tradition, He set forth to preserve the sacred lore for the ages yet to come.\nWith divine purpose, the Lord did carve the sacred ŚS upon the stones of Mount Mahādev in the land of Kashmir, engraving them with His own divine essence so that they might endure for eternity. In His infinite grace, He appeared out of thin air in the form of Śrikanṭh Nātha, the embodiment of divine mastery and wisdom, and thus commanded the great sage, Ṛṣī Durvāsā, to safeguard this scripture and restore its glory.\n\n“Take heed, O Ṛṣī,” spake the Lord, “for this knowledge is the lifeblood of the universe, the eternal truth that binds creation. Preserve it with diligence, guard it with devotion, and ensure that its light doth not falter amidst the shadows of this age.”\n\nThus, by divine decree, the Ṛṣī Durvāsā became the appointed custodian of the Śaiva Āgamas, entrusted with the sacred charge of upholding the wisdom of ‘em, amidst the trials and tribulations of a world in decline. And so, the tradition endured, though battered by the tides of time, like a flame that resisteth the fiercest winds, ever shining as a beacon to those who seek the eternal truth.\nIn the Swaććhaṅda Tantra it is stated:—\nगुरुशिष्यपदे स्थित्वा स्वयं देवः सदाशिवः।\nप्रश्नोत्तरपदैर्वाक्यैस्तन्त्रमाधारभेदतः॥\n“Lord Sadāśiva Himself, the Eternal and Supreme Being, who is both the origin and the consummation of all wisdom, doth take upon Himself the roles of both Guru and Śiṣya, Master and Disciple. In His infinite grace and boundless compassion, He descendeth to this mortal plane, veiling His transcendent form to bridge the chasm of difference that doth arise in the minds of men.”\nIn this sacred descent, He doth impart the holy Tantras, not in lofty proclamations incomprehensible to the common ear, but through the art of dialogue—questions and answers exchanged betwixt Master and Disciple. By such means, the divine teachings are rendered accessible to the seekers of truth, even unto those ensnared by the illusions of duality and separation.\nThrough this celestial discourse, Lord Sadāśiva illuminates the path of unity that underlies all diversity, guiding souls from the base distinctions of this earthly realm unto the loftiest heights of realization. Each question raised doth serve as the voice of the yearning soul, and each answer given floweth as the nectar of divine wisdom, quenching the thirst of the spirit and dispelling the darkness of ignorance.\nThus, through His boundless love for creation, Lord Sadāśiva doth reveal that the Guru and the Śiṣya are not two, but one—the eternal truth manifest in dual forms, ever striving to awaken the slumbering soul to its own divine essence. And so, through His divine play, the eternal wisdom of the Tantras is preserved, a treasure trove of sacred knowledge bestowed upon the earth for the salvation of all who seek the light.\n“प्रष्ट्री च प्रतिवक्त्री च स्वयं देवी व्यवस्थिता”\n“The goddess herself, in her infinite grace and majesty, doth assume both the role of the questioner and the utterer of divine truths. Such is the profound mystery and sacredness encompassed within the very essence of the word Tantra. She, who is the mother of all creation and the fountainhead of wisdom, doth veil herself in the guise of seeker and speaker alike in front of Parameśvara Śankara, thus engaging in the celestial dialogue that unveileth the eternal truths of existence.”\nBehold, this sacred interplay between question and answer is not a mere device of mortal intellect, but a divine act, a cosmic revelation wherein the goddess herself doth manifest the eternal teachings. In her questions, she giveth voice to the yearning of all souls who wander in the darkness of ignorance, and in her answers, she poureth forth the nectar of divine wisdom, illuminating the path to liberation.\nFrom the vantage of tradition and the spiritual eye, it is clear that Tantra standeth beyond the bounds of time. It is not born of mortal hands nor subject to decay, but abideth as eternal as the heavens and as constant as the breath of life.

This divine discourse is known as the “Āgama,” the very essence of the wisdom imparted by the Great Lord. Another appellation for this scripture is “Tantra,” which bespeaks the universal expansion of Śiva himself. The term “Tantra” is derived from the root “tanu,” meaning to expand, and is suffixed with “tral” or “ṣtran,” thus conveying the boundless growth and universal unfolding of consciousness.\n![Pasted image 20250113160605.png](../metadata/images/Pasted image 20250113160605.png)\nThis expansion pertaineth not to the gross realm alone but to the infinite Universal Consciousness. Behold Paramśiva, who in his sovereign freedom doth contract himself into the root-consciousness, hesitating at the precipice of manifestation. Yet, by his own volition, he removeth this hesitation, employing myriad means to reclaim his limitless nature. This cosmic dance of contraction and expansion, of concealment and revelation, constitutes the very heart of Tantra Śāstra—a path to self-recognition, a highway to the rediscovery of one’s divine nature.\nThe Pillars of Tantra: Mantra, Tantra, and Yantra\nThough Tantra standeth as an independent domain of knowledge, it is integrally woven into a triad. Preceded by Mantra and succeeded by Yantra, it formeth a continuum. The Mantra is the seed, the primordial vibration that unveileth the essence of matter. Tantra is the art of combining and harmonizing these energies, weaving them into a tapestry of expansion. Finally, the Yantra, a geometric embodiment, represents this cosmic interplay, marked by symbols, letters, and lines that denote the union of the mundane and the divine.\nWhen the undifferentiated, transcendental existence known as param descendeth into the realm of knowledge, it manifesteth as Mantra. This knowledge, when directed towards action, becometh Tantra. Through the chanting of Mantras, the seeker’s inner faculties awaken, energizing the body’s subtle centers and piercing the mystical chakras. The Yantra, in turn, encodeth these processes, offering a map of the aspirant’s journey toward spiritual realization.\nThe Twofold Aspect of Tantra\nIn Tantra, there exist two dimensions: the worldly (laukika) and the otherworldly (alaukika). The worldly aspect explores the vast expanse of nature and its hidden mysteries, rendering these forces amenable to human will. The otherworldly dimension seeks to uncover the ultimate truth, transcending the veil of multiplicity to behold the singularity of Universal Consciousness. Thus, Tantra harmonizeth both instinct and renunciation. Through instinct, it serveth both the individual and society; through renunciation, it leadeth to the supreme state of seeing “Śivatva” in all creation and dissolving the ego into the infinite.\nŚiva and Śakti: The Eternal Union\nThe universe is composed of but two principles: Śiva, the unchanging witness, and Śakti, the dynamic force. Though distinct in context, they are ultimately one, like the sun and its rays. Śiva is the first grammatical person, the self-contained “I.” Śakti is the second grammatical person, the reflective “Thou.” The interplay between these two principles—the emergence of the “I” and the return of the “Thou” to its source—is the sacred narrative of Tantra Śāstra.\n\nThe Sanskrit anusvāra (अं) symbolizeth the state of thoughtlessness, the undifferentiated essence of Śiva. When Śiva separateth himself from himself, creation—represented by visargaḥ (अः)—beginneth. This visargaḥ embodies the union of Śiva and Śakti, the cosmic dance of duality and unity. When two points of visargaḥ unite, they form a triangle. The upward triangle (△) representeth Śiva; the downward triangle (▽) representeth Śakti. Together, they form the six-pointed star (⛥), a symbol of their eternal union.\nThe Śrī Ćakra: The Microcosm and the Macrocosm\nAll beings are microcosmic reflections of Śiva and Śakti. In the human form, marrow, life force, and soul arise from Śiva, while blood, flesh, and fluids emanate from Śakti. The Śrī Ćakra, a geometric mandala, encodeth this duality and unity, linking the individual to the cosmos. The body and the universe mirror each other, as declared in the axiom, Yathā Pinde, Tathā Brahmānde (“As in the body, so in the universe”). The seeker who penetrateh the elemental veils ascendeth through the levels of pure knowledge, culminating in the state of Unmanā, where duality dissolveth and Śiva and Śakti are realized as one.\nThe Vast Domain of Tantra\nTantra encompasseth three divisions of Śivamukhokta scriptures: Āgama, Yāmal, and Tantra. Āgama describeth creation, destruction, deity worship, and mantrasādhanā. Yāmal expoundeth upon cosmic elements, astrology, daily duties, and the laws of eras. Tantra itself is vast, addressing topics as diverse as universal dissolution, yantras, cosmology, timelines, moral duties, and spiritual practices. It holdeth within its domain all material and spiritual pursuits, offering a comprehensive path to self-realization and cosmic unity.\nThus, Tantra revealeth the sacred art of merging the self with the infinite, of recognizing the divine in all, and of walking the path to Śiva’s embrace. It is a journey of exploration, an eternal dialogue between Śiva and Śakti, and the ultimate realization of one’s own divinity.\n—  Ｎａｇｋｕｍａｒ です."},"Trika/trika-is-everything":{"title":"☆ “TRIKA” is EVERYTHING ॐ","links":["Introduction/kashmir-shaivism/schools-of-kashmir-shaivism"],"tags":["trikashasan","trika","agama","everything","kashmirshaivism","shiva","shakti","anu","avarohakrama","arohakrama","threefold","science","nature","reality","individualconsciousness","universalconsciousness","articles"],"content":"the sacred and ancient lore of trika, often termed as the “threefold science,” standeth as a cornerstone of the exalted tradition of schools of kashmir shaivism. within its hallowed precepts, one doth encounter a consummate revelation of divine truth, encompassing all existence in its triadic embrace. as recounted by the venerable gurudeva swāmi lakṣamaṇajū mahārāj, trika, in its essence, is everything &amp; pervadeth all. its name, trika, signifieth the triadic nature of reality, wherein the unity of existence is understood as the interplay of threefold nature manifest in the universal order.\n\n☆ the threefold nature of reality\ntrika unveileth the sacred pattern of triplicity in creation. it speaketh of the triad of vedyā (the knowable), vedan (knowledge), and vedak (the knower); of the states of wakefulness (jāgrat), dreaming (svapna), &amp; deep sleep (suṣupti); &amp; of creation, preservation, and destruction. even within the mystical gāyatri mantra, the triad of bhur, bhuvaḥ, and svaha doth reflect this sacred science. to present these manifold aspects as a singular, cohesive wisdom is the ultimate essential nature of trika śāstra, the scripture of the threefold path.\n\nin this divine doctrine, the supreme śiva is the origin and culmination of all. trika describeth the process of manifestation through “अवरोह-क्रम” (avaroh-krama) | ° śiva 》 ° śakti 》 ° aṇu (descent) | and liberation through “आरोह-क्रम” (āroh-krama) | ° aṇu 》 ° śakti 》 ° śiva (ascent) |. when śiva descendeth, he entereth the worldly state, assuming the form of aṇu (the individual self) through the medium of śakti. in this state, he experienceth the discomfort of limitation. yet, by his own grace, he ascendeth once more to his supreme essence, returning to the boundless freedom of śiva.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“अवरोह-क्रम” (avaroh-krama)“आरोह-क्रम” (āroh-krama)| ° śiva 》 ° śakti 》 ° aṇu || ° aṇu 》 ° śakti 》 ° śiva |\nthis divine interplay of descent and ascent, as my permanent gurudeva swāmi lakṣamaṇajū mahārāj did expound, is the līlā (drama)—the cosmic play of existence. it is meaningful only when the movements of descent and ascent are in harmonious balance. without the capacity for both, there is no true drama. thus, the recognized soul is distinguished by their mastery of both movements, descending and ascending at will, embodying the state of absolute freedom, which is the very essence of trikaśāsan.\n☆ the importance of experience &amp; initiation\ntrika philosophy doth assert that divine knowledge cannot be grasped through words alone but through the sacred act of initiation by real direct lineage trika master. vaikhari vāk (words), as swāmiji expounded, are but vessels bereft of essence without the infusion of experience. he narrated the tale of nāradamuniji and sanat kumār, wherein the nāradamuniji, though learned in all scriptures, was admonished for lacking the inner realization of their meaning. thus, experience surpasseth intellect, and initiation becometh the gateway to divine comprehension.\nyet, the path to initiation is arduous, for an enlightened master is rare amidst the multitude. as swāmiji observed, it is by the grace of parābhairava alone that one doth encounter such a master. this divine grace guideth the seeker to the feet of the realized teacher, who then awakens the latent understanding of the disciple.\n☆ trika &amp; tantra\nthe sacred trika is often intertwined with the teachings of tantra, particularly the brutally non-dual bhairavāgama-s, which are themselves a manifestation of the trika doctrine. tantra is divided into threefold branches: bheda tantra (dualistic), bhedābheda tantra (dual cum non-dualistic), and abheda tantra (non-dualistic). the bhairavāgama-s, being of the non-dual abheda tradition, do encompass and embody the trika philosophy, for they describe the ultimate unity of universal consciousness and individual consciousness.\n☆ the sevenfold path to trika\nswāmiji elucidated that the seven practices of ācāra-s are not distinct but constitute steps leading to the summit of trika. these practices are unified in their purpose, guiding the aspirant to the recognization the threefold science.\ntrika encompasseth the essence of parā (oneness), parāpara (dual cum non-dual), aparā (duality), representing the interplay of aṇu (individual consciousness), śiva (universal consciousness), &amp; svātaṅtrya śakti (independent energy). it is the eternal dance of unity.\nthus, trika śāstra illumineth the path to ultimate recognization, wherein the aspirant doth transcend the illusion of separateness and recognize their unity with the divine. the sacred dance of śiva and śakti, the eternal interplay of descent and ascent, unfoldeth the mystery of existence, revealing that all is but the singular reality of the parābhairava.\nin the words of my gurudeva swāmiji, trika is everything, for it is the sacred science of unity, the key to liberation, and the essence of divine truth.\n—  Ｎａｇｋｕｍａｒ です."},"Trikashasan/vedas/aparatantrik-analysis-of-vedas":{"title":"aparatantrik analysis of vedas","links":[],"tags":["trikashasan","viewpoint","articles","kashmirshaivism","vedas","paratantras","paraparatantras","aparatantras","comparativestudies","history"],"content":"In sooth, Bhārat, a land most hallowed, hath ever been a sanctuary of unity amidst diversity. From ancient days long past, the streams of sacred knowledge and manifold sciences have flowed in abundance upon this blessed soil. The Vedā-s, Upaniṣads, Purānā-s, Vedānga-s, and the sciences spiritual and material, known as Ādhibhautik, have endured through the ages, upheld in the venerable traditions of study and instruction. Amongst these, Philosophy doth stand as a noble channel, guiding the flow of wisdom. The ultimate aim of all knowledge and sciences, verily, is naught but the attainment of felicity in the mundane realm. Yet the paths prescribed by other scriptures beget but fleeting and incomplete joy, whereas Philosophy alone doth offer the royal highway to supreme and enduring bliss.\nOf Western philosophy, it may be said that it doth discourse much upon principles, yet its practical aspect is woefully wanting, as if it were a bird with but one wing.\nIn Bhāratiya tradition, two mighty streams of philosophy have emerged: Naigmik and Āgamik. These twin rivers, like the sacred Gangā and Yamunā, do flow in harmony, bearing the principles and practices of their respective sādhanā-s. At the foundation of Naigmik, or Vedic Sādhanā, standeth the Vedā-s, whilst Tantra formeth the bedrock of Āgamik, or Tāntrik Sādhanā. In their primeval forms, both these sādhanā-s coursed along their pristine paths, untainted and pure. Yet, as time unfolded, a mingling and syncretism did arise betwixt these sacred traditions. Nay, more than this, the streams of Smārtha and Purānik traditions, rooted in Vedic sādhanā, likewise intermingled with the currents of Tāntrik practice.\nEven as secondary streams diverged and flourished within the realm of Vedic Sādhanā, so too did myriad branches arise within Tāntrik Sādhanā. The result of this sacred confluence was that both Vedic and Tāntrik traditions enriched one another, like two mirrors reflecting a greater whole. Thus, the scholars of Tantra Śāstra, in their wisdom, were compelled to proclaim:–\n“गर्भाधानादितः कृत्वा यावदुवाहमेव च।”\ngarbhādhānāditaḥ kṛtvā yāvaduvāhamevaca|\nAnd,\n“तावत्तु वैदिकं कर्म पश्चाच्छेवे हानन्यभाक्॥”\ntāvattu vaidikaṃ karma paścācċheve hānanyabhāk||\nतत्रास्य गर्भाधानं च युक्तं पुंसवनादिभिः।\nगर्भनिष्क्रामपर्यन्तैरेकां कुर्वीत संस्क्रियाम्॥\n—तं. आ. १७.३६\ntatrāsya garbhādhānaṃ ċa yuktaṃ puṇsavanādibhiḥ|\ngarbhaniṣkrāmaparyaṇtairekāṃ kurvīt saṇkriyām||\ntạṃ. ā. 17. 36\nVeda and Tantra, though clad in the garments of word, are verily but two facets of the selfsame knowledge. This knowledge, divine and eternal, is imperishable. Though the word “Veda” may, from an outward perspective, yield various meanings, in its essence it signifieth a transcendental and extrasensory verbal subtlety.\nThe mantra-dṛṣṭa ṛṣis, those sages who beheld the mantras, attained omniscience through this subtle knowledge and thereby achieved self-realization, rendering their lives most triumphant. Thus, it is written in the Purākalpa:–\n“यां सूक्ष्मां नित्यामतीन्द्रियां वाचं ऋषयः साक्षात्कृतधर्माणो मन्त्रदृशः पश्यन्ति तां असाक्षात्कृतधर्मेभ्यः परेभ्यः प्रतिवेदयिष्यमाणा बिल्वं समामनन्ति स्वप्ने वृत्तमिव दृष्टश्रुतानुभूतमाचिख्यासन्ते।”\n“yāṃ sukṣmāṃ nityāmatīṇdriyāṇ vācaṃ ṛṣayaḥ sākṣātkṛtdharmāno mantradṛśaḥ paśyanti tāṃ asākṣātkṛtdharmebhyaḥ parebhyaḥ prativedayiśyamānā bilvaṃ samāmanaṇtī swapne vṛttmiva dṛṣtaśrutanubhūtamāchikhyāsante.”\nThe sages, who have grasped the essence of Dharma, do daily perceive the subtle speech that lieth beyond the senses. Yet those unversed in the principles of Dharma remain blind to its vision. To illuminate such minds, the sages revealed the extrasensory speech through the manifest Vedā-s, which serve as vessels for the divine Word. The Vedā-s, or Vedānga-s, may thus be likened to the sacred “Bilva,” wherein the gross sensory speech is but a means to express the sublime dreamscapes of extrasensory perception. Even as the unutterable Parāvāk, the subtle speech, cannot directly manifest before ordinary mortals, save the mantra-seeing sages, so do the Vedā-s, as incarnate forms of Parāvāk, bridge the ineffable to the tangible. Yet, they are not its full form, for Parāvāk remaineth beyond mortal grasp, indivisible and eternal. The Vedā-s are one, unbroken, and inseparable in their true essence. They are not merely verbal constructs but cognitive realities. At the moment of articulation, they take on the semblance of words, manifesting as sequences of sound.\nThese sacred scriptures are the pathways to Śiva, the ultimate reality. The attainment of Śiva is achieved by unraveling the knot of “Ahaṃ,” which manifesteth as the duality of “Ahaṃ” (I) and “Maṃ” (Mine). The extant Vedā-s, in their manifold forms, are but reflections of the unmanifest, indivisible Veda. Even the great Yogi Bhartṛhari hath declared the Vedā-s as but imitations of this higher truth–\nप्राप्त्युपायोऽनुकारश्च तस्य वेदो महर्षिभिः।\nएकोऽप्यनेकवर्त्मेव समाम्नातः पृथक्पृथक्॥\n—वा. प. १.५\nprāptyupāyoऽnukāraśca tasya vedo maharṣibhiḥ\nekoऽpyanekavartmeva samāṃnātaḥ pṛṯakpṛṭak\n—vā. pa. 1.5\nThe Vedā-s, are the sole Aparātantra, being both cognitive and verbal in nature. In the great Lord Śiva, the Samvetā Śakti, the unified power, is manifest in threefold form: Īcchā ; Jñāna ; and Krīyā . Of these, the power of Will remaineth transcendent and ineffable. Jñānarūpiṇī Śakti, the power of Knowledge, is of two kinds: Parājñāna (transcendental cognition) and Aparājñāna (verbal cognition). The latter, being verbal, giveth rise to scriptures, wherein knowledge is expressed through words and interpretation.\nAt the dawn of creation, Lord Śiva, in his boundless grace, doth reveal the sacred knowledge of the Vedā-s for the liberation of souls. When this divine knowledge taketh on verbal form, it is known as Aparātantra. Thus, the Vedā-s, though manifest as word, are proven to be the Aparātantra of the highest order. Verily, the Vedā-s are both the path and the goal, the word and the silence, leading to the ultimate union with the eternal Śiva.\n—  Ｎａｇｋｕｍａｒ です."},"about-us":{"title":"info","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"hail, noble seeker, and welcome to the sacred domain of karpurgauram! we, a group of humble fellowship of devotees &amp;

Naturally pervading the body, it is the very essence of experience itself, shining forth as the root of divine consciousness and the infallible source of the manifestation of the entire creation.\n॥इति श्रीदेहस्थदेवताचक्रस्तोत्रं श्रीमदभिनवगुप्तपादविरचितम्॥\n|iti śrīdehasthadevatācakrastotraṃ śrīmadabhinavaguptapādaviracitam|\nThis is the sacred Dehasthadevatācakrastotram—the revered stotra on the chakra located in the body of the sense deities—composed by the most revered Master Abhinavagupta.\nTranslated by Nagkumar; Inspired from My Guru Īśvarasvarupa Swāmī Lakṣamaṇajū."},"scriptures/stavacintāmaṇiḥ":{"title":"stavacintāmaṇiḥ","links":[],"tags":["stavacintamani","bhattanarayana","scriptures"],"content":"“The Mystickal Pearl of One-pointedness” 01%\n— MAHĀMAHEŚVARĀĊĀRYA BHAṬṬA NĀRĀYAṆA\nॐ नमश्चिद्भैरवाय ।\n॥ अथः श्रीभट्टमारायणविरचितः स्तवचिन्तामणिः ॥\nOṃ namaścidbhairavāya |\nAtha śrībhaṭṭanārāyaṇaviracitaḥ stavacintāmaṇiḥ ||\nHail unto Bhairava, He who is all-consciousness.\nThis is the stotra-cintāmani composed by Śrī Bhatta-Mārāyaṇa.\nसुगिरा चित्तहारिण्या पश्यन्त्या दृश्यमानया ।\nजयत्युञ्ज्ञासितानन्द महिमा परमेश्वरः ॥१॥\nsugirā cittahāriṇyā paśyantyā dṛśyamānayā |\njayatyullāsitānanda mahimā parameśvaraḥ |1|\nThis marks the initial obeisance to Lord Śiva. We bow before Lord Śiva and offer our salutations, proclaiming, “Victory to the Divine Guru, Victory to Śiva.” When He [Lord Śiva] utters His sacred speech—His supreme, exquisite word (sugirā, meaning that most elevated and beautiful utterance)—it is citta hāriṇyā, capable of seizing your mind entirely, along with all its thoughts and perceptions. His single word captivates and dissolves your mind, stripping away every idea and concept. Through His compassionate gaze (paśyantyā), which beholds you with boundless grace, He initiates infinite waves of divine rapture within you (dṛśyamānayā). May that glorious Lord Śiva triumph! May He reign victorious—the One whose word silences the mind and its illusions, and whose merciful glance dispels all anxieties and sorrows.\nReflections:\nThe nature of the Supreme speech of Lord Śiva is that sound which is the very essence of consciousness. It is Spanda—the unspoken resonance, the silent vibration.\nयः स्फीतः श्रीदयाबोधपरमानन्दसंपदा ।\nविद्याद्दश्याततमाहात्म्यः स जयल्यपराजितः ॥ २ ॥\nyaḥ sphītaḥ śrīdayābodhaparamānandasaṁpadā |\nvidyoddyotitamāhātmyaḥ  sa jayatyaparājitaḥ ||2||\nMay that Lord Śiva always prevail, eternally triumphant—the One whose splendor is revealed through the magnificence of śrī-dayā-bodha-paramānandasaṁpadā. Śrī represents the abundance of pure awareness; dayā signifies compassion and benevolence. Through boundless grace, through the wealth of divine consciousness, through immense kindness, through bodha (universal wisdom), and through paramānanda (absolute bliss), He is exalted. May Lord Śiva, glorified by the radiance of universal awareness, by ever-present compassion, by supreme knowledge (bodha), and by the highest ecstasy (paramānanda), be victorious.\nLet Him be victorious—the One whose greatness is illuminated and empowered by vidyā, by śuddhavidyā, the most refined and sacred wisdom. May that infinite consciousness reign supreme in all directions, pervading everywhere.\nReflections:\nThese are two ślokas, simple prayers dedicated to Lord Śiva. Now, Bhaṭṭa Nārāyaṇa will commence these sacred hymns of devotion, and we shall go through them, one by one."},"videos":{"title":"videos","links":["☆-“TRIKA”-is-EVERYTHING-ॐ"],"tags":["videos"],"content":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYOUTUBE VIDEOS BY Ｎａｇｋｕｍａｒ です.LETEST UPLOADSMEDITATIONSDIKSHA &amp; INITIATION☆ “TRIKA” is EVERYTHING ॐHOW TO POSSESS MAHĀŚIVARĀTRĪTHE SCIENCE OF TANTRĀLOKA—CH01THE SCIENCE OF TANTRĀLOKA—CH01EP01: साधना के उपायोंका प्रथम पारस्‍परिक परिचयIn this video I shall introduce you to the upāya-s of sādhanā: ŚĀMBHOPĀYA, ŚĀKTOPĀYA. ĀṆAVOPĀYA and little explanations on each upāya that how these upāya-s work.THE SCIENCE OF TANTRĀLOKA—CH01EP02: शाम्भव अवस्था; निर्विकल्प अवस्था और रहस्यमयी समावेशIn this video I shall tell you about the end goal of three upāya-s of sādhanā: ŚĀMBHOPĀYA, ŚĀKTOPĀYA. ĀṆAVOPĀYA; that which known as ŚĀṂBHAVA AVASTHĀ [STATE] and with the help of examples of human life v/s a śivayogīṇ&#039;s life, I try to explain that how this śāṃbhava state works and how it really feels.THE SCIENCE OF TANTRĀLOKA—CH01EP03: शाम्भवोपाय की विधी तथा आवेश की परिभाषाIn this video I shall introduce you to the very first upāya the “ŚĀṂBHAVOPĀYA” and how does it work or how to apply it practically, for sādhanā. Also I will continue on the previous episode&#039;s explanation of ŚĀṂBHAVA AVASTHĀ [STATE] and SAMĀVEŚĀ of ŚĀṂBHAVOPĀYA. I will try to explain the method in order to succeed in entry to śāṃbhava samāveśā.THE SCIENCE OF TANTRĀLOKA—CH01EP04: शाक्तोपाय की विधी तथा आवेश की परिभाषाIn this video I shall introduce you to the very second upāya “ŚĀKTOPĀYA” and how does it work or how to apply it practically, for sādhanā. “ŚĀKTOPĀYA” is defined as the means which exists in the world of mono-duality, in the world where duality and non-duality exist together, is “ŚĀKTOPĀYA.” I will try to explain the method in order to succeed in entry to śāktā—śāṃbhava samāveśā.THE SCIENCE OF TANTRĀLOKA—CH01EP05: आनवोपाय की विधी तथा आवेश की परिभाषाIn this video I shall introduce you to the very third upāya “ĀṆAVOPĀYA” and how does it work or how to apply it practically, for sādhanā. “ĀṆAVOPĀYA” is defined as an inferior means which exists in the world of duality, in the world where only duality exists and is also known as “Bhedopāya.” In “ĀṆAVOPĀYA”, the strength of your awareness is such that you have to take the support of everything as an aid to maintain and strengthen your awareness.THE SCIENCE OF TANTRĀLOKA—CH01EP06: अनुपाय—प्रकाशन और काश्मीर शैवावाद मे मोक्ष की परिभाषाIn this video I shall introduce you to the “AṆŪPĀYA.” AṆŪPĀYA means, where there is no upāya, where there is no adoption of any way, any method to attain this state. As if this “AṆŪPĀYA” would be the state, then in that case and that is really existing–that AṆŪPĀYA, for that there is no way to explain or attain it with any practice, you can’t practice that AṆŪPĀYA. “AṆŪPĀYA” is defined very similar to the svātantrya of śiva which exists in everything instantaneously. But just to get the firm understanding to the entry in that AṆŪPĀYA state, I have tried to sum it up in this video as per the instructions from my gurudeva.THE SCIENCE OF TANTRĀLOKA—CH01EP07: काश्मीर शैववाद मे बौद्धज्ञान और पौरुषज्ञान की परिभाषाIn this enlightening video we delve deep into the profound teachings of Kashmir Śaivism, exploring the intricate relationship between ignorance (ajñāna) and knowledge (jñāna) as the keys to liberation. Drawing from sacred śāstras, we discuss how ignorance binds us to the cycle of saṁsāra, leading to repeated births and deaths, while true knowledge liberates us from these bonds. We explore the concept of mala or impurity in its various forms—āṇavamala, māyīyamala, and kārmamala—and how they obscure our true nature, which is all-Being (sat), all-consciousness (cit), and all-bliss (ānanda). Discover the distinction between pauruṣa ajñāna (practical ignorance) and bauddha ajñāna (intellectual ignorance), and how these forms of ignorance are overcome through the grace of a master, meditation, and the study of monistic Śaiva texts. This video also highlights the importance of balancing pauruṣa jñāna (practical knowledge) and bauddha jñāna (intellectual knowledge) on the path to becoming a jīvanmukta—one who is liberated while still living. Learn why finding a master who embodies both these forms of knowledge is crucial for spiritual progress.THE SCIENCE OF TANTRĀLOKA—CH01EP08: काश्मीर शैववाद मे वाक सिद्धांत की परिभाषाIn this video we shall delve deep into the profound wisdom of Kashmir Shaivism with an intricate exploration of the VĀKĆATUṢTAYA SIDDHĀNTA, the esoteric understanding of speech &amp; its fourfold manifestation. We unravel the secrets of Parā, Paśyantī, Madhyamā &amp; Vaikharī, the four stages of speech and their sub-states described in the ancient texts of Trikaśāsan. Gain a clear understanding of Kashmir Śaivism’s intricate philosophy of speech.
