**the sacred and ancient lore of trika**, often termed as the “**threefold science**,” standeth as a cornerstone of the exalted tradition of [[Introduction/kashmir shaivism/schools of kashmir shaivism\|schools of kashmir shaivism]]. within its hallowed precepts, one doth encounter a consummate revelation of divine truth, encompassing all existence in its triadic embrace. as recounted by **the venerable gurudeva swāmi lakṣamaṇajū mahārāj**, `trika, in its essence, is everything & pervadeth all`. its name, **trika**, `signifieth the triadic nature of reality, wherein the unity of existence is understood as the interplay of threefold nature manifest in the universal order`.

==☆ the threefold nature of reality==

**trika unveileth the sacred pattern of triplicity in creation. it speaketh of the triad of vedyā (the knowable), vedan (knowledge), and vedak (the knower); of the states of wakefulness (jāgrat), dreaming (svapna), & deep sleep (suṣupti); & of creation, preservation, and destruction. even within the mystical gāyatri mantra, the triad of bhur, bhuvaḥ, and svaha doth reflect this sacred science. to present these manifold aspects as a singular, cohesive wisdom is the ultimate essential nature of trika śāstra, the scripture of the threefold path.**

| \| ° śiva 》    | ° śakti 》     | ° aṇu \|      |
| -------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| **\| ° aṇu 》** | **° śakti 》** | **° śiva \|** |

**in this divine doctrine, the supreme śiva is the origin and culmination of all.** **trika describeth the process of manifestation through** “`अवरोह-क्रम`” (`avaroh-krama`) **| ° śiva 》 ° śakti 》 ° aṇu** (*descent*) **|** and **liberation through** “`आरोह-क्रम`” (`āroh-krama`) **| ° aṇu 》 ° śakti 》 ° śiva** (*ascent*) **|**. **when śiva descendeth, he entereth the worldly state, assuming the form of aṇu** (*the individual self*) through **the medium of śakti.** **in this state, he experienceth the discomfort of limitation.** y**et, by his own grace, he ascendeth once more to his supreme essence, returning to the boundless freedom of śiva.**

**this divine interplay of descent** and ascent, as **my permanent gurudeva swāmi lakṣamaṇajū mahārāj** did expound, **is the līlā (drama)—the cosmic play of existence**. `it is meaningful only when the movements of descent and ascent are in harmonious balance`. **without the capacity for both, there is no true drama. thus, the recognized soul is distinguished by their mastery of both movements, descending and ascending at will, embodying the state of absolute freedom, which is the very essence of trikaśāsan.**

==☆ the importance of experience & initiation==

**trika philosophy doth assert that divine knowledge cannot be grasped through words alone but through the sacred act of initiation by real direct lineage trika master. `vaikhari vāk` (words), as swāmiji expounded, are but vessels bereft of essence without the infusion of experience. he narrated the tale of nāradamuniji and sanat kumār, wherein the nāradamuniji, though learned in all scriptures, was admonished for lacking the inner realization of their meaning. thus, experience surpasseth intellect, and initiation becometh the gateway to divine comprehension.**

**yet, the path to initiation is arduous, for an enlightened master is rare amidst the multitude. as swāmiji observed, it is by the grace of parābhairava alone that one doth encounter such a master. this divine grace guideth the seeker to the feet of the realized teacher, who then awakens the latent understanding of the disciple.**

==☆ trika & tantra==

**the sacred trika is often intertwined with the teachings of tantra, particularly the brutally non-dual bhairavāgama-s, which are themselves a manifestation of the trika doctrine. tantra is divided into threefold branches: `bheda tantra` (dualistic), `bhedābheda tantra` (dual cum non-dualistic), and `abheda tantra` (non-dualistic). the bhairavāgama-s, being of the non-dual abheda tradition, do encompass and embody the trika philosophy, for they describe the ultimate unity of universal consciousness and individual consciousness.**

==☆ the sevenfold path to trika==

**swāmiji elucidated that the seven practices of ācāra-s are not distinct but constitute steps leading to the summit of trika. these practices are unified in their purpose, guiding the aspirant to the recognization the threefold science.**

**trika encompasseth the essence of `parā` (oneness), `parāpara` (dual cum non-dual), `aparā` (duality), representing the interplay of `aṇu` (individual consciousness), `śiva` (universal consciousness), & `svātaṅtrya śakti` (independent energy). it is the eternal dance of unity.**

thus, **trika śāstra illumineth the path to ultimate recognization**, wherein **the aspirant doth transcend the illusion of separateness and recognize their unity with the divine**. the sacred dance of **śiva and śakti**, **the eternal interplay of descent and ascent, unfoldeth the mystery of existence, revealing that all is but the singular reality of the parābhairava**.

**in the words of my gurudeva swāmiji, trika is everything, for it is the sacred science of unity, the key to liberation, and the essence of divine truth.**
