<pre style="text-align: center;">  
open the linux—
of your heart;
like a witch with—
her black-cat;
giggle & trust in—
siva's wonders;
fly into my dreams—
like a butterfly on—
a bloomed lotus;
feel the love 
& independence—
in its wide-spreading petals;
groove with a gleam—
reflecting your glory;
shout so loud that—
you'll always be mine—
side-by-side, like a life-line;
............................

even if those 
magickal loka-s—
betrays us, you'll—
still hold me as yours;
it'll be forever like—
an amazing eternal-yāmala—
in our own universe of our love...!
