<pre style="text-align: center;">  
the moon glows bright
on my bash prompt tonight
not an error to be seen...
       
a kingdom of config files
and it looks like ima the king
the wind is howling like this
swirling storm inside
couldn't keep it in
heaven knows i've tried
don't let them in
don't let them see
be the microsoft slave
you always have to be...

conceal; don't feel
don't let them know
well now they know
let it go; let it go

can't hold it
back anymore
let it go; let it go...

turn away and
slam the door
i don't care
what they're going to say
let the storm rage on
i use kāli linux by the way...

it's funny how some distros
make everyone seem small
and the gates that once
controlled me now can't
get to me at all...

it's time to see
what i can do
to test the limits
and break through

no right
no wrong
no rules
for me
im free!

let it go
let it go

im one with
the root & CLI

let it go
let it go

you'll never

see me cry
here i sit
and here
i'll stay

let the storm rage on
my power flurries
through the air
into the shell

to recompile
my kernel again
surely will be hell
i haven't been outside
soon i'll be splited
i'm never going back
i get push with force
let it go; let it go...

and i'll rise like
the break of dawn
let it go; let it go...

the proprietary
software is gone!
here i sit
and here i'll stay
let the storm rage on
i use kāli linux by the way!
