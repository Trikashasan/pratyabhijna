## ]■[ "Kula System." ]■[

⎯ The **Kula** system teaches you **how you can live in caitanya** (universal Consciousness), **the real nature of yourself, in the act of ascending and descending. While you rise from the lowest to the highest you realize your nature, and while you descend from the highest to the lowest you also realize your nature.**

*“In the Kula system, there is no break in the realization of your own nature either in the highest or in the lowest cycle. This system, therefore, teaches you how you can live in totality.”*

In fact, **the word kula means “totality.”**

In the practice of the Kula system, you have to realize **the totality of the universe in one particle.** **Take one particle of anything that exists in this world; in that one particle is to be realized the totality of the whole universe. The totality of energy is found in one particle. Everything is full of one thing and one thing is full of all things.**

The difference between the **Pratyabhijna** system and the **Kula** system is, that the Pratyabhijna system teaches you **how to realize your own nature in one place and exist there, reside there.** While the Kula system teaches you **how you can rise from the lowest degree to the highest degree, and all the while, experience the nature of your Self on the same level and state.** `Shiva, which is realized in prithvi tattva (earth element), is the same level, the same reality of Shiva which is realized in Shiva tattva.` Here, there is complete realization in **every act of the world.**

The Kula system was introduced in Kashmir in the beginning of the 5th century A.D. by Shri **Macchandanatha**. Later, in the 9th century, because its teachings had become distorted, it was reintroduced by **Sumatinatha**. In the line of masters that followed from **Sumatinatha, Somanatha** was his disciple. **Shambhunatha** was the disciple of **Somanatha**, and the great **Abhinavagupta** was the disciple of **Shambhunatha**.
