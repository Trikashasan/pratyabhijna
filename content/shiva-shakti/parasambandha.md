According to the esoteric traditions of Kashmir, Tantra is held to be eternal, a truth without beginning and without end. Even as the sacred Vedās, revered through the Tāntrik Ṣruti Tradition, are esteemed to have been known and practiced in this mortal realm since time beyond reckoning, so too hath the sacred path of Tantra been followed by the unbroken lineage of Tāntrik Gurus. Yea, in truth, the Ṣruti Tradition itself was in its origin none other than the Tāntrik method, which was later embraced and woven into the streams of the Vedik way.

Tantra, eternal as the heavens and profound as the cosmic depths, hath ever been the foundation of sacred knowledge. It is the primal root whence the Ṣruti Tradition sprang, the wellspring of divine revelation that shaped the Vedik streams. Through the ages, the Gurus of Tantra, torchbearers of mystic wisdom, have passed this sacred practice from heart to heart, preserving its essence against the tide of forgetfulness. This tradition is not new nor of recent invention; rather, it is the timeless truth, veiled yet constant, stretching from the dawn of creation unto the endless ages to come.

Thus, in solemn remembrance and deep reverence, it is understood that the Tantra, being the cradle of spiritual wisdom, abideth as eternal as the soul itself.

**As, Mahāmaheśvara Trikāćārya Somānaṅda Nāth Ji, of noble wisdom and mastery, doth proclaim:—**


`शैवादीनि रहस्यानि पूर्वमासन् महात्मनाम्।` 
`ऋषीणां वक्त्रकुहरे तेष्वेवानुग्रहक्रिया॥`
`कलौ प्रवृत्ते यातेषु तेषु दुर्गमगोचरे।` 
`कलापिग्रामप्रमुखे समुच्छिन्ने च शासने॥` 
`कैलासाद्री भ्रमन् देवो मूर्त्या श्रीकण्ठया सह।` 
`अनुग्रहायावतीर्णश्चोदयामास भूतले॥` 
`मुनिं दुर्वाशसं नाम भगवानूर्ध्वरेतसम्।` 
`नोच्छिद्येत यथा शास्त्रं रहस्यं कुरु तादृशम्॥`

In the days of yore, when the world was young and wisdom flowed as freely as the rivers from the mountains, the sacred scriptures known as the Śaiva Āgama were borne upon the lips of the venerable sages. These holy utterances, untainted by the touch of mortal hands, were the very embodiment of the Ṣrutiparaṃpara, the unbroken lineage of divine oral transmission. Thus did the sages, keepers of this celestial knowledge, bestow their favors upon their disciples, passing down the sacred teachings from heart to heart, as a lamp doth kindle another without diminishing its flame.

Yet, as the wheel of time turned and the shadow of Kāli Yuga fell upon the earth, this esoteric tradition waned, its light dimmed and its presence confined to but a solitary village known as Kalāpi. In this darkened age, when wisdom was scarce and the hearts of men were heavy with the burden of ignorance, the Great Lord Parameśvara Śankara, the Supreme One, walked amidst the celestial peaks of Mount Kailash. Moved by compassion for the fading tradition, He set forth to preserve the sacred lore for the ages yet to come.

With divine purpose, the Lord did carve the sacred #ŚS upon the stones of Mount Mahādev in the land of Kashmir, engraving them with His own divine essence so that they might endure for eternity. In His infinite grace, He appeared out of thin air in the form of Śrikanṭh Nātha, the embodiment of divine mastery and wisdom, and thus commanded the great sage, Ṛṣī Durvāsā, to safeguard this scripture and restore its glory.

> “Take heed, O Ṛṣī,” spake the Lord, “for this knowledge is the lifeblood of the universe, the eternal truth that binds creation. Preserve it with diligence, guard it with devotion, and ensure that its light doth not falter amidst the shadows of this age.”

Thus, by divine decree, the Ṛṣī Durvāsā became the appointed custodian of the Śaiva Āgamas, entrusted with the sacred charge of upholding the wisdom of 'em, amidst the trials and tribulations of a world in decline. And so, the tradition endured, though battered by the tides of time, like a flame that resisteth the fiercest winds, ever shining as a beacon to those who seek the eternal truth.

**In the Swaććhaṅda Tantra it is stated**:—

`गुरुशिष्यपदे स्थित्वा स्वयं देवः सदाशिवः।` 
`प्रश्नोत्तरपदैर्वाक्यैस्तन्त्रमाधारभेदतः॥`

 “`Lord Sadāśiva Himself, the Eternal and Supreme Being, who is both the origin and the consummation of all wisdom, doth take upon Himself the roles of both Guru and Śiṣya, Master and Disciple. In His infinite grace and boundless compassion, He descendeth to this mortal plane, veiling His transcendent form to bridge the chasm of difference that doth arise in the minds of men`.”

In this sacred descent, He doth impart the holy Tantras, not in lofty proclamations incomprehensible to the common ear, but through the art of dialogue—questions and answers exchanged betwixt Master and Disciple. By such means, the divine teachings are rendered accessible to the seekers of truth, even unto those ensnared by the illusions of duality and separation.

Through this celestial discourse, Lord Sadāśiva illuminates the path of unity that underlies all diversity, guiding souls from the base distinctions of this earthly realm unto the loftiest heights of realization. Each question raised doth serve as the voice of the yearning soul, and each answer given floweth as the nectar of divine wisdom, quenching the thirst of the spirit and dispelling the darkness of ignorance.

Thus, through His boundless love for creation, Lord Sadāśiva doth reveal that the Guru and the Śiṣya are not two, but one—the eternal truth manifest in dual forms, ever striving to awaken the slumbering soul to its own divine essence. And so, through His divine play, the eternal wisdom of the Tantras is preserved, a treasure trove of sacred knowledge bestowed upon the earth for the salvation of all who seek the light.

`“प्रष्ट्री च प्रतिवक्त्री च स्वयं देवी व्यवस्थिता”`

 “`The goddess herself, in her infinite grace and majesty, doth assume both the role of the questioner and the utterer of divine truths. Such is the profound mystery and sacredness encompassed within the very essence of the word Tantra. She, who is the mother of all creation and the fountainhead of wisdom, doth veil herself in the guise of seeker and speaker alike in front of Parameśvara Śankara, thus engaging in the celestial dialogue that unveileth the eternal truths of existence`.”

Behold, this sacred interplay between question and answer is not a mere device of mortal intellect, but a divine act, a cosmic revelation wherein the goddess herself doth manifest the eternal teachings. In her questions, she giveth voice to the yearning of all souls who wander in the darkness of ignorance, and in her answers, she poureth forth the nectar of divine wisdom, illuminating the path to liberation.

From the vantage of tradition and the spiritual eye, it is clear that Tantra standeth beyond the bounds of time. It is not born of mortal hands nor subject to decay, but abideth as eternal as the heavens and as constant as the breath of life. For in the goddess’s sacred act of questioning and uttering, the very essence of Tantra is revealed—a timeless tradition, a living truth, a divine grace bestowed for the upliftment of all beings.
