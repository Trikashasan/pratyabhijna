**Kashmir Shaivism** is known as the Pure **Trika** System. The word `Trika` means “==the threefold science of man and his world.==” **In the idea of trika, there are three Śakti-s (energies):** `parā` (supreme), `aparā` (lowest), and `parāpara` (combination of the lowest and the highest). These three primary energies represent the threefold activities of the world. In the thought of the Trika, therefore, it is admitted that this whole universe and every action in it, whether spiritual, physical, or worldly, is existing in these three energies.

** - Swāmi Lakṣamaṇa Jū**

The Trika System is comprised of four sub-schools; the [[Introduction/pratyabhijna/pratyabhijñā\|pratyabhijñā]] school, the [[Introduction/kula-akula/kula\|kula]] school, the [[Introduction/krama/krama\|krama]] school, and the [[Introduction/spanda/spanda\|spanda]] school. These four systems, which form the one thought of the Trika system, all accept and are based on the same scriptures (Āgama-s). These scriptures form the ninety-two Āgama-s of Shaivism. The monistic Bhairava Śāstra-s are supreme (parā) and are sixty-four in number; the mono-dualistic Rudra Śāstra-s are medium (parāpara) and are eighteen in number; and the dualistic Śiva Śāstra-s are inferior (aparā) and are ten in number.
