## ]■[ "Krama System." ]■[

⎯ The **Krama** system does not recognize the ways of either the Pratyabhijna or the Kula system. In the Krama system, **you must rise in succession**, step by step. This system teaches that step-by-step realization makes your realization firm. As the Krama system is concerned with successive realization, it is primarily concerned with space and time, because where there is succession there you find the existence of space and time. In both the Pratyabhijna and Kula systems you are beyond space and time. In the Krama system, it is in the end, not in its process, that you are beyond time and space because it also carries you to that timeless and space-less state.

> “The Krama system is primarily attributed to shaktopaya and to the twelve Kalis.”

**The twelve Kalis are said to be the twelve movements of any one cognition.** For *example*, if you look at any object such as a pot, the sensation travels from your thought to the place of the pot, and then returns again from the place of the pot to your thought, giving you the sensation whereby you realize this pot. You do not realize this pot at the place of the pot, you realize this pot in your mind. Your perception has moved from inside to the pot, and then returned again from the pot to your thought. And these movements are distributed in **twelve ways as the twelve Kalis** in the Krama system.

The rise of **prana kundalini** is also described in the Krama system, because in prana kundalini you rise from one cakra to another, from one state to another state. As this is a successive process it is found in the Krama system.

Although the Krama system existed in the beginning of kali-yuga, having been introduced by the sage **Durvasa**, it was reintroduced at the end of the 7th century A.D. in Kashmir by the sage **Erakanatha**, who was also known as **Shivanandanatha.** **Shivanandanatha** had only three chief disciples which he initiated into the Krama system. Because in this system predominance is given only to **shakti**, all three were females. Their names were **Keyuravati, Madanika, and Kalyanika.** They were quite prominent and were completely informed in the Krama system. Afterwards, these ladies also initiated disciples, which were both male and female.
