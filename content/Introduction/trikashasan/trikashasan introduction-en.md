#### The stream of Bhāratiya knowledge and practice has been flowing in two forms, Vedik and Āgama. If the root of the Vedik flow is the exhalation of Vāmdeva, one of the mouths of Lord Swachchandanātha Bhairava, then the root of the Āgamaic or Tāntrik flow is the speech of the five mouths of Lord Swachchandanātha Bhairava, and the Bhairavāgamadhārā (Bhairavāgamik flow)—eternal; indifference; is free and secret; And this stream is always implemented by the spontaneous grace of Lord Swachchandanātha Bhairava.

#### After this, the Rudragāma which is dual-cum-nondual and the Shivagāma which is dual etc. are streams. In later times, the followers of both these and the followers of Vedik etc. streams influenced each other and the doctrines, customs and practices of one became partly mixed with the doctrines, customs and practices of the other. As a result, a mixed moral tradition prevailed. Rudrasukta in Vedic literature; Śwetāśvatara; Paśupāt; Brahma; Tripuratāpini; Tripurā; Katharudra; The use of Vedik mantras in the Upanishads like Bhāvanā and Tāntrik worship and practice is a gift of these systems. Even so, Tāntrik literature has some basic principles of its own that make it completely distinct and perfect from Vedik literature.

#### All philosophies accept the Supreme Being in the root of the universe in some form or the other. “Trikahṛdaya” and “Trikaśāsan” are the basic foundation of all those philosophies & religions. The Supreme Being that has been accepted here is undivided. In the deepest state of the Absolute, it is impossible to imagine 'Ćidānaṇda.' It is the "Niranśa Anūttar Parā" state. In this deepest state of Sanmātra, one aspect of the Supreme Being springs out in the form of self-illumination, which is called 'Ćit' or 'Ćiti' in the language of Trika. This 'Ćidbhāv of his is the initial light of his outward orientation. It is called “Anūttara” in the language of Bhairavāgamas.

#### The “अ” (a) of the Sanskrit language or of the Mātṛkā Ćakra of the Śiva Sutra symbolizes this “Anūttara” state. From that Supreme Being this consciousness continues to emerge eternally. Just as the mind is externalized because of the vibration in bliss, so the mind also vibrates. As a result of this vibration, on the one hand, the mind holds on to bliss; So on the other hand, it produces a second mind. This second mind sees its form when it is reflected in the first mind. This recognition or favorable sensation of his own being is called “bliss”.

#### In the behavioral world, this is like a mirror image situation; But this mirrored reflection is partially indistinguishable from Śiva. This deduction proves that the unbroken entity is the form of the mind. This entity is independent, that is, other-neutral. Satyaṃ Śivaṃ Sundaraṃ expresses this same essence. It is the form of mind in terms of expression of pure Śiva and bliss in terms of taste. According to the Trinity rule, Paraṃ Śiva and Paraṃ Śakti are indistinguishable. Both are Ćidrupa and are integral in the same way as fire and its combustible power.

#### This is the state of ultimate equality “Yāmala” or “inclusion”. There is no gender distinction. Although this is a state of indifference, the discriminating Aṇu (individual) sees the difference in it. From the worldly point of view, “Parābhairava” is always fivefold.

## “TRIKAŚĀSAN” ALSO KNOWN AS “TRIKĀĆĀRA”: 
### Vedāćāra, Vaiśnavaćāra, Śaivāćāra, Dakṣīnāćāra, Vāmāćāra, Siddhāntāćāra, Kaulāćāra, all these sequences of conduct are meant to elevate the seeker to the highest “TRIKĀĆĀRA”.

#### There are two sides to “TRIKAŚĀSAN SVĀTAṆTRYAVĀDA”:— 1] The philosophical side and; 2] The Sādhanā aspect.
#### Analysis of the philosophical aspect, the Great “Trikahṛdaya–Siddha” gurus like Lord Śri Mahāmaheśwara Somānaṇda, Lord Śri Mahāmaheśwara Bhaṭṭakallatji, Lord Śri Mahāmaheśwara Vāsuguptaji, Lord Śri Mahāmaheśwara Utpaldevaji, Lord Śri Mahāmaheśwara Abhinavaguptaji have described Pratyabhijñā and Vibration; order; in philosophical texts like Śivadṛṣṭī, Īśvarpratyabhijñā, Spandakārīkā, Tantrāloka etc. related to the clan. The intriguing spiritual mysteries of the Sādhanā aspect have been explained in many Bhairavāgama texts like Tantrāloka and Śriparātriṃśikā, Śri Svachchanda Tantra of Gurudev Bhagavān Śri Mahāmaheśwara Abhinavaguptaḥ. On the philosophical side, the basic principles established by various logical arguments have been universally accepted and certain. Those principles have not been refined or modified at any level to date. There have been many forms of the adverse cultivation side, since ancient times. In order to bring into experience the spiritual facts explained in the philosophical aspect, different Trika Siddha Gurus adopted different types of sādhanā paths and also initiated their disciples accordingly. These different types of sādhanā paths were given the name of āćāras. “TRIKĀĆĀRA” is also one of these principal practices, and the Śaiva “TRIKAŚĀSAN” tradition of Kashmir is called “Abhed–Trikāćāra” as a whole.
