<span class="center-text">— `MAHĀMAHEŚVARĀĊĀRYA BHAṬṬA NĀRĀYAṆA`</span>

<span class="center-text">`ॐ नमश्चिद्भैरवाय ।`</span>

<span class="center-text">`॥ अथः श्रीभट्टमारायणविरचितः स्तवचिन्तामणिः ॥`</span>

<span class="center-text">`Oṃ namaścidbhairavāya |`</span>
<span class="center-text">`Atha śrībhaṭṭanārāyaṇaviracitaḥ stavacintāmaṇiḥ ||`</span>

<span class="center-text">Hail unto Bhairava, He who is all-consciousness.</span>
<span class="center-text">This is the stotra-cintāmani composed by Śrī Bhatta-Mārāyaṇa.</span>

<span class="center-text">`सुगिरा चित्तहारिण्या पश्यन्त्या दृश्यमानया ।`</span>
<span class="center-text">`जयत्युञ्ज्ञासितानन्द महिमा परमेश्वरः ॥१॥`</span>

<span class="center-text">`sugirā cittahāriṇyā paśyantyā dṛśyamānayā |`</span>
<span class="center-text">`jayatyullāsitānanda mahimā parameśvaraḥ |1|`</span>

<span class="center-text">This marks the initial obeisance to Lord Śiva. We bow before Lord Śiva and offer our salutations, proclaiming, "Victory to the Divine Guru, Victory to Śiva." When He [Lord Śiva] utters His sacred speech—His supreme, exquisite word (sugirā, meaning that most elevated and beautiful utterance)—it is citta hāriṇyā, capable of seizing your mind entirely, along with all its thoughts and perceptions. His single word captivates and dissolves your mind, stripping away every idea and concept. Through His compassionate gaze (paśyantyā), which beholds you with boundless grace, He initiates infinite waves of divine rapture within you (dṛśyamānayā). May that glorious Lord Śiva triumph! May He reign victorious—the One whose word silences the mind and its illusions, and whose merciful glance dispels all anxieties and sorrows.</span>

<span class="center-text">**Reflections:**</span>
<span class="center-text">The nature of the Supreme speech of Lord Śiva is that sound which is the very essence of consciousness. It is Spanda—the unspoken resonance, the silent vibration.</span>


<span class="center-text">`यः स्फीतः श्रीदयाबोधपरमानन्दसंपदा ।`</span>
<span class="center-text">`विद्याद्दश्याततमाहात्म्यः स जयल्यपराजितः ॥ २ ॥`</span>

<span class="center-text">`yaḥ sphītaḥ śrīdayābodhaparamānandasaṁpadā |`</span>
<span class="center-text">`vidyoddyotitamāhātmyaḥ 
sa jayatyaparājitaḥ ||2||`</span>

<span class="center-text">May that Lord Śiva always prevail, eternally triumphant—the One whose splendor is revealed through the magnificence of śrī-dayā-bodha-paramānandasaṁpadā. Śrī represents the abundance of pure awareness; dayā signifies compassion and benevolence. Through boundless grace, through the wealth of divine consciousness, through immense kindness, through bodha (universal wisdom), and through paramānanda (absolute bliss), He is exalted. May Lord Śiva, glorified by the radiance of universal awareness, by ever-present compassion, by supreme knowledge (bodha), and by the highest ecstasy (paramānanda), be victorious.

Let Him be victorious—the One whose greatness is illuminated and empowered by vidyā, by śuddhavidyā, the most refined and sacred wisdom. May that infinite consciousness reign supreme in all directions, pervading everywhere.</span>

<span class="center-text">**Reflections:**</span>

<span class="center-text">These are two ślokas, simple prayers dedicated to Lord Śiva. Now, Bhaṭṭa Nārāyaṇa will commence these sacred hymns of devotion, and we shall go through them, one by one.</span>
