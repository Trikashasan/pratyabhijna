<span class="center-text">Hail unto Bhairava, He who is all-consciousness.</span>
<span class="center-text">This is the stotra-cintāmani composed by Śrī Bhatta-Mārāyaṇa.</span>

<span class="center-text">`सुगिरा चित्तहारिण्या पश्यन्त्या दृश्यमानया ।`</span>
<span class="center-text">`जयत्युञ्ज्ञासितानन्द महिमा परमेश्वरः ॥१॥`</span>

<span class="center-text">`sugirā cittahāriṇyā paśyantyā dṛśyamānayā |`</span>
<span class="center-text">`jayatyullāsitānanda mahimā parameśvaraḥ |1|`</span>

This is the initial salutation to Lord Śiva. We bow down before the feet of Lord Śiva and offer our respects, declaring, “Victory to the Divine Guru, Victory to Śiva.” When Lord Śiva utters His holy voice—that supreme, matchless and divine utterance (that is, that highest and most beautiful utterance)—He completely subjugates your mind, with all its thoughts and conceptions. His single word attracts your mind and dissolves it, erasing every thought and imagination. His compassionate glance, which is filled with infinite grace, sends within you infinite waves of divine bliss. May the glorious Lord Śiva always triumph! May He always triumph—He, whose word silences the mind and its delusions, and whose glance of grace dispels all worries and sorrows.

<span class="center-text">**Reflections:**</span>
The form of Lord Śiva's supreme voice is the sound that is the essence of consciousness itself. It is the pulse - the unspoken resonance, Parāvāk—the silent motionless-vibration.


<span class="center-text">`यः स्फीतः श्रीदयाबोधपरमानन्दसंपदा ।`</span>
<span class="center-text">`विद्याद्दश्याततमाहात्म्यः स जयल्यपराजितः ॥ २ ॥`</span>

<span class="center-text">`yaḥ sphītaḥ śrīdayābodhaparamānandasaṁpadā |`</span>
<span class="center-text">`vidyoddyotitamāhātmyaḥ 
sa jayatyaparājitaḥ ||2||`</span>

May Lord Śiva be eternally victorious, eternally triumphant—He whose glory is manifested through the divine splendor of śrī-dayā-bodha-paramānandasaṁpadā. Śri is the infinite richness of pure consciousness; Dayā is the epitome of compassion and benevolence. He is supremely glorious through infinite grace, the immense wealth of divine consciousness, infinite grace, bodha (all-pervading knowledge), and paramānanda (ultimate bliss).

May Lord Śiva, who is radiant with the radiance of omnipresent consciousness, eternal compassion, supreme knowledge (Bodha), and supreme bliss, be eternally victorious.

May He be eternally victorious—He whose greatness is illuminated and empowered by the light of Vidyā and Śuddha Vidyā (the purest and most subtle knowledge). May that infinite consciousness pervade all directions, circulate everywhere, and rule over the entire universe.

These are two verses, simple prayers dedicated to Lord Śiva. Now Bhaṭṭa Nārāyaṇa will begin these sacred devotional hymns, and we will go through them one by one.
