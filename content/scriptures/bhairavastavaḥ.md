— `MAHĀMAHEŚVARĀĊĀRYA ABHINAVAGUPTAḤ`


`व्याप्तचराचरभावविशेषं`</span>
`चिन्मयमेकमनन्तमनादिम्।`</span>
`भैरवनाथमनाथशरण्यं`</span>
`तन्मयचित्ततया हृदि वन्दे॥१॥`</span>

transliteration:—</span>
`vyāpta-carācara-bhāva-viśeṣaṁ`</span>
`cinmayam-ekam-anantam-anādim |`</span>
`bhairava-nātham-anātha-śaraṇyaṁ`</span>
`tan-maya-citta-tayā hṛdi vande |1|`</span>

translation:—</span> 
I do humbly venerate with unwavering devotion, I beseech Thee, O Supreme Lord Śiva, whose presence encompasseth all that is and ever shall be. Thou, in Thine infinite grace, dost unveil Thyself through realization as the boundless Bhairavanātha, the mighty Protector of the bereft and helpless. To Thee, O Eternal One, do I render mine prayer and homage, with all the fervor of mine soul.


`त्वन्मयमेतदशेषमिदानीं`</span>
`भाति मम त्वदनुग्रहशक्त्या।`</span>

`bhāti mama tvad-anugraha-śaktyā |`</span>
`tvaṁ ca maheśa! sadaiva mamātmā`</span>
`svātmam-ayaṁ mama tena samastam |2|`</span>

translation:—</span>
By the puissance of Thy grace hath it been made manifest unto me that this trembling universe is naught but Thine own being. Verily, O Lord Siva, this understanding hath dawned upon me—that Thou art mine own soul, and thus doth this vast cosmos stand revealed as mine own expression and essence.`


`स्वात्मनि विश्वगते त्वयि नाथे`</span>
`तेन न संसृतिभीतिः कथाऽस्ति।`</span>
`सत्स्वपि दुर्धरदुःखविमोह-`</span>
`त्रासविधायिषु कर्मगणेषु॥३॥`</span>

`satsvapi durdhara-duḥkha-vimoha-`</span>
`trāsa-vidhāyiṣu karma-gaṇeṣu |3|`</span>

translation:—</span>
O Thou who holdest dominion o’er all, though Thy devotees, ensnared by the bonds of karma and the fetters of the mutable mind, be caught in the web of destiny, which stirreth up trials and chains of bondage, yet are they unshaken by the cares and tribulations of this mortal realm. For having beheld this universe as naught but Thine own essence, they fear not the woes of the world. Forsooth, fear can arise only where there existeth an other to cause it; but when none is, save Thee alone, whence can fear spring forth?


`अन्तक! मां प्रति मा दृशमेनां`</span>

`bhīṣaṇa-bhairava-śakti-mayo‘smi |4|`</span>

translation:—</span>
O Thou who art the Destroyer of Death, turn not Thy wrathful and fearsome gaze upon me, for I am ever immersed in the worship of Lord Siva. Through unwavering devotion, ceaseless meditation, and profound contemplation, I have become steadfast of heart and bold of spirit, united with the dreadsome power of Bhairava. Thus, Thy fearsome and terrible visage hath no power to harm me.


`इत्थमुपोढ़भवन्मयसंवि-`</span>
`द्दीधितिदारितभूरितमिस्रः।`</span>
`मृत्युर्यमान्तककर्मपिशाचै-`</span>
`र्नाथ! नमोऽस्तु न जातु बिभेमि॥५॥`</span>

translation:—</span>
Unto Thee, O Lord Bhairava, I render mine obeisance, for Thou hast unveiled unto me the sacred truth that Thou alone art the essence of all existence. By this divine revelation, the murk and obscurity of my mind hath been utterly vanquished. Neither do I tremble before the vile host of demons, nor am I dismayed by Yama, the fearsome Keeper of Death.

O Lord Siva, through the revelation of Thy divine essence, made known unto me by true wisdom, I perceive that all attachments and all which doth exist within this vast universe are quickened by Thee alone. By this sacred awakening, my mind is filled to overflowing with undying devotion, and therein do I taste the sweetness of supreme bliss.


`मानसगोचरमेति यदैव`</span>
`क्लेशदशाऽतनुतापविधात्री।`</span>
`नाथ! तदैव मम त्वदभेद-`</span>
`स्तोत्रपराऽमृतवृष्टिरुदेति॥७॥`</span>

Yet, in that selfsame hour, when Thy grace doth descend as a gentle shower, a pure and lucid vision of mine oneness with Thee doth arise. By the might of this divine realization, my troubled mind is soothed and made serene.

`tāvaka-śāstra-parā’mṛta-cintā`</span>
`syandati cetasi nirvṛtti-dhārām |8|`</span>

translation:—</span>
O Lord Siva, it is oft proclaimed that through charity, ritual bath, and the observance of penance, the burdens of worldly life may be eased. Yet, greater than all these, by the remembrance of the sacred śástras and Thy divine utterances, the stream of immortality, like a river of peace, doth flow into my heart, bringing with it solace and serenity beyond compare.


`नृत्यति गायति हृष्यति गाढं`</span>
`संविदियं मम भैरवनाथ!।`</span>
`त्वां प्रियमाप्य सुदर्शनमेकं`</span>
`दुर्लभमन्यजनैः समयज्ञम्॥९॥`</span>

O Lord Bhairava, through the depth of mine unwavering faith, have I beheld Thee in the singular sacrifice of oneness, a union unattainable by the mere performance of countless rites. Enveloped by Thy presence, my very consciousness doth dance and sing in fervent joy, reveling in the ecstasy of its own divine bliss.

O compassionate Lord, moved by the radiance of Thy glory and for the welfare of Thy devoted worshippers, I, Abhinavagupta, have wrought this hymn. Through the meditation and recitation of these sacred verses, in but a fleeting moment, that merciful Lord Bhairava doth bring an end to the torments and sufferings that arise from the endless wilderness of saṁsāra.
