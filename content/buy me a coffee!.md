*you have reached the edge of sacred digital nexus of karpurgauram, where we try to reveal the ancient code to the modern consciousness. we are but humble devs in the cosmic repository, committing the eternal wisdom of trikaśāsan to the vast expanse of the digital age.*

**if our transmissions—be they encrypted in philosophy, or pure bhairava energy—have sparked something in your soul’s algorithm, consider powering the server.**

<span class="center-text">☕ `sudo support – coffee=true`</span>
<span class="center-text">**UPI:** `karpurgauram@kotak` or `nagkumar@pingpay`</span>

every contribution keeps the script running, the dharma deploying, and the transmission unbroken.

🌺 may your kernel be bug-free & your consciousness rooted in bhairava 🌺

jay gurudeva <3.
