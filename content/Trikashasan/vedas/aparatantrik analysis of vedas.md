In sooth, **Bhārat**, a land most hallowed, hath ever been a sanctuary of unity amidst diversity. From ancient days long past, the streams of sacred knowledge and manifold sciences have flowed in abundance upon this blessed soil. The Vedā-s, Upaniṣads, Purānā-s, Vedānga-s, and the sciences spiritual and material, known as Ādhibhautik, have endured through the ages, upheld in the venerable traditions of study and instruction. Amongst these, Philosophy doth stand as a noble channel, guiding the flow of wisdom. The ultimate aim of all knowledge and sciences, verily, is naught but the attainment of felicity in the mundane realm. Yet the paths prescribed by other scriptures beget but fleeting and incomplete joy, whereas Philosophy alone doth offer the royal highway to supreme and enduring bliss. 

Of Western philosophy, it may be said that it doth discourse much upon principles, yet its practical aspect is woefully wanting, as if it were a bird with but one wing.

In **Bhāratiya** tradition, two mighty streams of philosophy have emerged: Naigmik and Āgamik. These twin rivers, like the sacred Gangā and Yamunā, do flow in harmony, bearing the principles and practices of their respective sādhanā-s. At the foundation of Naigmik, or Vedic Sādhanā, standeth the Vedā-s, whilst Tantra formeth the bedrock of Āgamik, or Tāntrik Sādhanā. In their primeval forms, both these sādhanā-s coursed along their pristine paths, untainted and pure. Yet, as time unfolded, a mingling and syncretism did arise betwixt these sacred traditions. Nay, more than this, the streams of Smārtha and Purānik traditions, rooted in Vedic sādhanā, likewise intermingled with the currents of Tāntrik practice.

Even as secondary streams diverged and flourished within the realm of Vedic Sādhanā, so too did myriad branches arise within Tāntrik Sādhanā. The result of this sacred confluence was that both Vedic and Tāntrik traditions enriched one another, like two mirrors reflecting a greater whole. Thus, the scholars of Tantra Śāstra, in their wisdom, were compelled to proclaim:–

`“गर्भाधानादितः कृत्वा यावदुवाहमेव च।”`
`garbhādhānāditaḥ kṛtvā yāvaduvāhamevaca|`

And,

`“तावत्तु वैदिकं कर्म पश्चाच्छेवे हानन्यभाक्॥”` 
`tāvattu vaidikaṃ karma paścācċheve hānanyabhāk||`

`तत्रास्य गर्भाधानं च युक्तं पुंसवनादिभिः।` 
`गर्भनिष्क्रामपर्यन्तैरेकां कुर्वीत संस्क्रियाम्॥` 
`—तं. आ. १७.३६`
`tatrāsya garbhādhānaṃ ċa yuktaṃ puṇsavanādibhiḥ|`
`garbhaniṣkrāmaparyaṇtairekāṃ kurvīt saṇkriyām||`
`tạṃ. ā. 17. 36`

Veda and Tantra, though clad in the garments of word, are verily but two facets of the selfsame knowledge. This knowledge, divine and eternal, is imperishable. Though the word "Veda" may, from an outward perspective, yield various meanings, in its essence it signifieth a transcendental and extrasensory verbal subtlety. 

The mantra-dṛṣṭa ṛṣis, those sages who beheld the mantras, attained omniscience through this subtle knowledge and thereby achieved self-realization, rendering their lives most triumphant. Thus, it is written in the Purākalpa:–

`“यां सूक्ष्मां नित्यामतीन्द्रियां वाचं ऋषयः साक्षात्कृतधर्माणो मन्त्रदृशः पश्यन्ति तां असाक्षात्कृतधर्मेभ्यः परेभ्यः प्रतिवेदयिष्यमाणा बिल्वं समामनन्ति स्वप्ने वृत्तमिव दृष्टश्रुतानुभूतमाचिख्यासन्ते।”` 
`“yāṃ sukṣmāṃ nityāmatīṇdriyāṇ vācaṃ ṛṣayaḥ sākṣātkṛtdharmāno mantradṛśaḥ paśyanti tāṃ asākṣātkṛtdharmebhyaḥ parebhyaḥ prativedayiśyamānā bilvaṃ samāmanaṇtī swapne vṛttmiva dṛṣtaśrutanubhūtamāchikhyāsante.”` 
 
The sages, who have grasped the essence of Dharma, do daily perceive the subtle speech that lieth beyond the senses. Yet those unversed in the principles of Dharma remain blind to its vision. To illuminate such minds, the sages revealed the extrasensory speech through the manifest Vedā-s, which serve as vessels for the divine Word. The Vedā-s, or Vedānga-s, may thus be likened to the sacred "Bilva," wherein the gross sensory speech is but a means to express the sublime dreamscapes of extrasensory perception. Even as the unutterable Parāvāk, the subtle speech, cannot directly manifest before ordinary mortals, save the mantra-seeing sages, so do the Vedā-s, as incarnate forms of Parāvāk, bridge the ineffable to the tangible. Yet, they are not its full form, for Parāvāk remaineth beyond mortal grasp, indivisible and eternal. The Vedā-s are one, unbroken, and inseparable in their true essence. They are not merely verbal constructs but cognitive realities. At the moment of articulation, they take on the semblance of words, manifesting as sequences of sound. 

These sacred scriptures are the pathways to Śiva, the ultimate reality. The attainment of Śiva is achieved by unraveling the knot of "Ahaṃ," which manifesteth as the duality of "Ahaṃ" (I) and "Maṃ" (Mine). The extant Vedā-s, in their manifold forms, are but reflections of the unmanifest, indivisible Veda. Even the great Yogi Bhartṛhari hath declared the Vedā-s as but imitations of this higher truth–

`प्राप्त्युपायोऽनुकारश्च तस्य वेदो महर्षिभिः।` 
`एकोऽप्यनेकवर्त्मेव समाम्नातः पृथक्पृथक्॥`
`—वा. प. १.५`
`prāptyupāyoऽnukāraśca tasya vedo maharṣibhiḥ`
`ekoऽpyanekavartmeva samāṃnātaḥ pṛṯakpṛṭak`
`—vā. pa. 1.5`

The Vedā-s, are the sole Aparātantra, being both cognitive and verbal in nature. In the great Lord Śiva, the Samvetā Śakti, the unified power, is manifest in threefold form: Īcchā <Will>; Jñāna <Knowledge>; and Krīyā <Action>. Of these, the power of Will remaineth transcendent and ineffable. Jñānarūpiṇī Śakti, the power of Knowledge, is of two kinds: Parājñāna (transcendental cognition) and Aparājñāna (verbal cognition). The latter, being verbal, giveth rise to scriptures, wherein knowledge is expressed through words and interpretation.

At the dawn of creation, Lord Śiva, in his boundless grace, doth reveal the sacred knowledge of the Vedā-s for the liberation of souls. When this divine knowledge taketh on verbal form, it is known as Aparātantra. Thus, the Vedā-s, though manifest as word, are proven to be the Aparātantra of the highest order. Verily, the Vedā-s are both the path and the goal, the word and the silence, leading to the ultimate union with the eternal Śiva.
